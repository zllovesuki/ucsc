Which was a shame because it had a lot of potential of being a really awesome class, the overall subject was interesting. Zhang seems like a nice person, but you can barely understand her. I never listened in class, I spent 20 minutes on homework max, I never read anything. And somehow I managed getting an A.","rDate":"04/04/2010","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"person","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"poor","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":16914074,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":1,"rClass":"ISM58","rComments":"Zhang genuinely cares for her students and their performance in the class.
