His lectures are incomprehensible at times to non ENVS majors, and he rambles.  He's a nice guy, but his tests are hard and he grades pretty hard.  A lot of work as well.  If you are looking for a nice professor then he's your guy.  But if you want someone who will help you understand, and will provide more clarity look elsewhere IMO.","rDate":"12/18/2013","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":3,"rOverallString":"3.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Mandatory","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":22347929,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":4,"rClass":"ENVS119","rComments":"SJSU students, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS if you're trying to fulfill a GE/SJSU Studies requirement!!

Few homework assignments(if you are at all competent at math, they're easy). Midterm and final are open-notebook, hence the need for good notes!
