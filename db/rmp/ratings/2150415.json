Even asks for constructive feedback and goes the extra mile when asked. He made simulations of hydride shifts, molecular orbitals, electron density about the oxyallyl anion, and more for us. Lecture is more important than the textbook, but you learn so much. Tests are fair, and overall pretty fun.","rDate":"06/07/2016","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"N/A","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"Yes","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":["TEST HEAVY","LECTURE HEAVY","Caring"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"person"}]
