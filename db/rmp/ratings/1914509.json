No nonsense, and if there is, we get a chuckle. If you look at her lecture notes (which she puts online with great detail) as you do the homework, then review 'em both for the midterm and the final, you'll be fine. I never even bought the textbook, and (I'm pretty sure) I passed quite easily.

She gives minimal examples in lecture and assigns problems that were never even remotely covered. Key formulas were often missing from her notes, making it even more confusing.
