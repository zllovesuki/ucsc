His quizzes and exams heavily draw from lecture slides and homework/book questions. Pretty sure he always uses the same exams, in which case the second midterm will only have two questions so watch out. He's funny and it's worth attending his office hours. Also very easy to talk to and is passionate about the subject.","rDate":"03/27/2013","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"person","usefulGrouping":"person"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":19950941,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":4,"rClass":"EE101","rComments":"Don't make mistakes on midterm questions or your grade will \"die by partial credit.\" You can be heavily penalized for sign errors, unit omissions in your calculations (even if your final answer has the correct unit), silly mathematical errors, and much much more.
