Attendance is mandatory. She assigns crazy amounts of reading and literally spends 2 minutes of class time discussing it. Like she will stand there and ask a question and if you don't answer she'll be snide about I.e. 'this is not a trick question'. You can tell she's new at this, has yet to develop a teaching style.","rDate":"03/24/2013","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":2,"rInterest":"Meh","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
