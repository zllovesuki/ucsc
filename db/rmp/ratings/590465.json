He is unfair when it comes to grading. Class is offered once a year so failing it will delay your graduation by one year. Does not follow his syllabus grading format.","rDate":"08/20/2007","rEasy":5,"rEasyString":"5.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":1.5,"rOverallString":"1.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Mandatory","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":10451855,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"CMPS181","rComments":"Dr. Polyzotis is one of the best professors at UCSC.  If you are just looking to fulfill a requirement, his classes are not for you.  If you want to significantly enhance your knowledge about databases, you will find no better opportunity.

His lectures might lack zest or spice but they present great insight and are worth attending.
