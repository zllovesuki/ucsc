Never gave dates for small section assignments.  Shows you a bunch of pictures that she claims are \"good\" and expects you to do the same in this into class.  Photos are expected to revel some sort of meaning, when the only reason I took this class was to learn how to work a camera.

Both times, she was very nice and was there whenever you had questions or concerns about the class. Her classes are pretty fun, and her TA's are all really cool. Class isn't hard, but you still learn a lot of cool things.","rDate":"03/02/2015","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":3.5,"rOverallString":"3.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
