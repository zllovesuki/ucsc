She changed my life. She is the best Creative Writing teacher I've had yet, and I've taken many more after her. She pushed me to see myself as a writer, and continued to push me beyond mediocrity, especially in her comments on my work. Work hard in her course and reap the rewards.","rDate":"06/06/2010","rEasy":5,"rEasyString":"5.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":13553238,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"LTCR52","rComments":"Stacey was an awesome teacher and writer (I got to hear her read at an event) who helped me improve my writing exponentially.

She lacks heart, empathy, and  was both demanding and condescending.","rDate":"05/25/2005","rEasy":5,"rEasyString":"5.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":2,"rInterest":"Meh","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":3862990,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":4,"rClass":"LTCR52","rComments":"No-nonsense, and I generally appreciate the approach.
