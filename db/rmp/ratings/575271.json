He is very approachable, easy going, and very willing to answer questions.  Grading is 50% homework, 50% take home final.  Homework can be difficult, but he gives you plenty of time and will take homework questions.  He likes to make sure everyone in the class understnds the material before moving on.","rDate":"03/22/2006","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
