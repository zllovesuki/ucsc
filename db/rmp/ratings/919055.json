I'm always amazed by the wealth of knowledge and analysis she incorporates into the lectures post-screenings. I can tell she herself is very invested and excited about the topics and readings (both of which are extremely interesting) we discuss; however, her lecture slides are really verbose, and she tends to go on tangents.","rDate":"11/19/2015","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":3.5,"rOverallString":"3.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"A","teacherRatingTags":["Get ready to read","SO MANY PAPERS","LECTURE HEAVY"],"unUsefulGrouping":"person","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Mandatory","clarityColor":"poor","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"average","helpCount":1,"id":24639468,"notHelpCount":1,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":1,"rClass":"FILM185S","rComments":"Do not expect her classes to be film classes. They're much more concerned with sociohistorical and cultural discourses, using film as a window into these topics.

Two hours of rambling, hard to understand nonsense.
