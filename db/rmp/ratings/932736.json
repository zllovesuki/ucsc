He used powerpoints, which was a huge improvement over 163A. Make sure he continues to use these as a tool; it just might make or break your understanding of a wonderful -but difficult- chunk of material. Does curve.

However, he is extremely difficult to understand. Also, his lectures aren't very organized which exacerbates the problem. Perhaps if he used a powerpoint or gave an organized outline of each lecture this would help. His tests are hard and it's unclear what you are expected to know.","rDate":"03/24/2015","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":2.5,"rOverallString":"2.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":["Skip class?
