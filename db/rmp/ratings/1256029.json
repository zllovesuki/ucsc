She lectures on effective teaching but yet she cannot do it herself. There is so much potential for CAT 3 to be a great class but Stucky completely makes CAT 3 unbearable. She's really easy because she does not grade on content, just make sure she likes you. Easy A and W but shes annoying.","rDate":"02/20/2009","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Meh","rOverall":1,"rOverallString":"1.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
