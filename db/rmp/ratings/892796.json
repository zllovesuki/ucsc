Besides the dance, the assignments are pretty straightforward. She lets you use all your notes for the test, as well as her notes, and the required performance is a fun experience. Try to make it to hers if you can, its beautiful.","rDate":"11/30/2012","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":3.5,"rOverallString":"3.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":13901333,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":3,"rClass":"THEA80Z","rComments":"needs to make her lectures more interesting and requiring students to see 2 performances seems a bit unfair, however to get rid of 2 ges its a good class","rDate":"12/23/2007","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":3,"rOverallString":"3.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":12468863,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":4,"rClass":"THEA80Z","rComments":"The material would be very interesting if she found a way to relate it to anything practical, but she doesn't. She's also way too concerned about promoting her own dance company. The material seems pretty random, and in the end, you're no better of a dancer. You just know a silly little routine. She can also be rude at times.","rDate":"11/25/2006","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":2,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":3,"rOverallString":"3.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":12434197,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":2,"rClass":"THEA80","rComments":"Very interesting course, but she can be a little hard to understand sometimes.
