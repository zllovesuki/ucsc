On the other hand, he can be a little insensitive; he seems to have a low tolerance for opinions he doesn't agree with. Also, he sometimes used Spanish words in lecture, and I don't know Spanish.","rDate":"03/20/2008","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Low","rOverall":3.5,"rOverallString":"3.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"poor","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"poor","helpCount":0,"id":14059476,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awful","rClarity":1,"rClass":"LALSSECT","rComments":"So basically this week marks the first month of being in his class... and I have not learned one thing form his lectures.

He does assaign a lot of reading. Class can be hard, but i feel that it's just because he is very passionate about what he teaches. If you take him serriously, he will do the same.
