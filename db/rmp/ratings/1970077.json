Dr. Green enforces very clear, harsh policies. The content is based almost completely off lectures, so pay attention in class. If you do not understand the lecture go to your classmates, Dr. Green is hardly available and the TA was of no use. Paper reading heavy at times and tests are difficult and wordy.","rDate":"12/29/2014","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
