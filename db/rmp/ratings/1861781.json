He's not the most clear professor and he made the class much harder than it needed to be. To be fair it was his first time teaching and he's adorably dorky and excited to be teaching. However I wouldn't recommend taking his class unless chem is easy for you.

If I could do it again, I would skip chem 1P and just take chem 1A.
