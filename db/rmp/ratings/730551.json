This Law and the Holocaust was a total waste of time and money. I learned absolutely nothing and the material was totally random and in cohesive.

On the upside, his expectations are low and it's easy to get good grades on writing assignments. On the downside, the class is extraordinarily boring; I fell asleep at least twice this quarter.","rDate":"12/09/2006","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Low","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":12434706,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":2,"rClass":"CORESECT","rComments":"Although a nice person, I did not enjoy his class; it is very boring and random. He tries to be funny and a smart ass. All he ever asks is if Pluto is a planet and if it is not his life is not worth living anymore. Very Very random prof, I definitely did not like the class. Class had potential, he definitely killed it!
