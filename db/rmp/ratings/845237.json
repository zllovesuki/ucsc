She goes off on tangents, but they're usually fine. She likes to make jokes and show off how liberal she is.","rDate":"03/05/2008","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":3.5,"rOverallString":"3.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":13975395,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":5,"rClass":"LALS176","rComments":"She presented the material in a compelling and engaging way, including a fantastic compilation of articles and films.

There, I said it. She is really into the material, but in a really annoying way. The entire class she was hung up on how horrible society is and she never talked about anything else.
