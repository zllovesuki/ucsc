He has thorough knowledge of the material and amazing command of the piano, which greatly helps in providing examples for the class.  He is also very open to helping people out and wears awesome shoes.

You just wanna make him heaps of chocolate chip cookies. He is a GENIUS, but thinks the rest of us are, too. Hmmm maybe its just me.

He is a good teacher and hero.  He sticks his tongue out at students when they get the answer wrong and has an actual lightbulb that goes on in his head when he has a great idea.
