Being in his class to witness his contagious glimmering presence, inspires and drives students to learn more.

While not for the faint of heart, his classes are deep, intellectually stimulating, and in my case, life-changing. (I added a major because of him and am now going to Graduate School for Theatre.) I cannot recommend him enough. Work hard.

But he has a very bad habit of underestimating the ability and intelligence of his students, and his class suffers for this. Suffers a lot.
