The readings were really engaging, but it was very apparent that this was the first class Berney had ever taught.  Trivial weekly quizzes determined 40% of our grades (not too hard though). She lectured from behind her computer and presented a lot of irrelevant (and sometimes infuriating) material.

She made the subject super interesting and didn't take herself to seriously like some hiscon people do. She would take the time to explain something again and again if you didn't understand it, and was totally approachable. The TAs for the class (Trevor and Cindy) were both amazing as well!","rDate":"06/21/2006","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
