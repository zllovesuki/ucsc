She's also really kind and brought us snacks in the early morning class. She does not give helpful feedback on work. She asks unanswerable questions and then sits silently. Also her film choices in class were borderline un-watchable. She lets you debate your grade which is okay.","rDate":"02/16/2014","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":1.5,"rOverallString":"1.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"B","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":21707346,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":3,"rClass":"FILM170B","rComments":"Irene really knows film, but she likes more experimental/artsy themes.

The quality of your work doesn't seem to matter in this class, but whether she finds the work creatively interesting to her personal tastes, so everything is completely subjective.

Most students come in knowing a lot about film, but she does a decent job of putting everyone on an equal playing field. She's done a few feature films before and knows what she's talking about. A lot of work though, with assignments due almost every week of class. Not an easy A, unless you like film.","rDate":"11/13/2008","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
