It was pretty easy. If you actually do the homework and study the vocabs then you shouldn't have trouble passing this class with an A. The online hw could be time consuming but it helped a lot. Oh, I had to spend $160 on the hw code of the \"book\". Overall, this class was fun. It was his first time teaching Spanish.
