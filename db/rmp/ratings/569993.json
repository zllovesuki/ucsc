There is simply too much info and lots of math. The only upside is it is open book midterm and final so that allowed me to pass the class.

He does not use any visualization and seems to think that telling you how to program is adequate. Additionally, his handouts are almost incomprehensible. He seemed to assume that the majority in the class have programming experience, yet there is no such prereq.","rDate":"01/19/2012","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":2,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":14169854,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"EART119","rComments":"Gary is one of the best professors at UCSC.
