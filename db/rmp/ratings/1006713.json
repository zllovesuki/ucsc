The tests are really hard, but before the exam he tells you exactly what will be on it, and you have lots of opportunity to study. It's difficult to get an A in the class, but not difficult to pass if you go to lecture, section and keep up with the homework.","rDate":"06/23/2008","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":14588970,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"PHIL9","rComments":"Fruhling is awesome. He's very knowledgeable & enthusiastic. His lectures are clear & straight to the point. He takes you step-by-step. Fruhling is very helpful & takes students' best interests in mind. Phil9 isn't what most students think. It's really more of a math course where you translate arguments into notation and solve proofs.
