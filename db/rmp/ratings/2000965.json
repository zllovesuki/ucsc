He cares deeply about his students which is not something I see often w/econ teachers. I feel like most of us econ/bme majors are really just looking to get jobs & lead good lives after college; Terry wants that for us.

He shows that he loves accounting and is passionate about what he teaches. If people don't fall asleep all of the time during class then they will be able to perform well in the class.
