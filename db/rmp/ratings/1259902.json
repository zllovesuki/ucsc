I dreaded it every week. He rambles on about his point of view and asks open-ended questions looking for the precise answer that fits his viewpoint. He also said the course was based on questions on cards being handed in and offered an optional final, and gave me a B- when I chose not to take it. Waste.","rDate":"03/31/2010","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":16701362,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"poor","rClarity":2,"rClass":"PHYS75","rComments":"Rosenblum just wants you to agree with him. He's not interested in alternate points of view or interpretations, and he's too invested in his own opinions. He's too old to be teaching and should retire. He never let us talk amongst ourselves, only talked at us. Spent 7 weeks on boring intro physics. Total waste of time.
