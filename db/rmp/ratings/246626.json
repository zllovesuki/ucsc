Brij is a wonderful professor. His subject material is always engaging and interesting, but luckily, Brij brings an even greater energy to his classes because he is knowledgeable and passionate about what he teaches. I definitely recommend taking a class with him if you can.","rDate":"03/13/2006","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":11176635,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"KRSG80","rComments":"This guy is really awesome.
