The reading was pointless because he goes over the exact same things in class, step by step. Some of the homework he assigned w/o even looking at what it was and ended up canceling it once he discovered no one knew how to do it. I'll never take another class with him.","rDate":"04/09/2007","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"poor","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":12400675,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"poor","rClarity":1,"rClass":"LING80","rComments":"His grades are based entirely on quizzes, which have almost nothing to do with readings, which have almost nothing to do with his horrid lectures which never seem to pertain to anything relevant.

He has a great sense of humor about language, and is really able to pull the most important concepts out of the material. In some ways he oversimplifies things, but only because it's his first class and he is trying to make sure the class isn't overly difficult. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","rDate":"10/15/2006","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
