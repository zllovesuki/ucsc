Because of him, I passed the AWPE the second time around.  He gives great feedback on your essays and responds back fairly quickly to any questions you may have in class.

He truly tries to make the class enjoyable for his students and is always looking for new ways to get them interested. I took WRIT 2 Sustainable Future and I received an A. Just go to his office hours occasionally and get your essay critiqued by him. He's a good guy and often brings snacks as motivation!","rDate":"05/22/2014","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Low","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Mandatory","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":22534868,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":4,"rClass":"CORE","rComments":"Coulter's core class wasn't too bad.
