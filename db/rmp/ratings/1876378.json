He tells stories instead of lecturing, and ends up frequently wasting class time. He is very disorganized, he often posted assignments just hours before they were due, and didn't return any graded work until week 10. Most of his difficulty comes from having to navigate his disorganization and vague expectations.","rDate":"02/09/2014","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":2,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":1.5,"rOverallString":"1.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Not Mandatory","clarityColor":"poor","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"poor","helpCount":0,"id":22827337,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awful","rClarity":1,"rClass":"CMPS20","rComments":"I registered this class hoping to learn something and create actual game.
