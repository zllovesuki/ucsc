For a production class, it is highly theory-based and most classes are spent in a discussion of the week's reading.

All of class time is spent either going over the readings or watching films.  Not once did we get to work on our projects during class (which is in a lab) so the only way to get input before it's due is to go to her office hours.  READING IS A MUST...
