He really cares about his students, he's pretty chill and lenient, funny and down to earth. He makes class interesting, never puts anyone on the spot, and is very engaging.  Sean is AWESOME!

He assigned a lot of work for the quarter especially for a lower division class. He spends class time talking AT you rather than TO you.
