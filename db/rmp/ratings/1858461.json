Given its a GE class he actually makes it interesting by not simply reading off the slides but actually explaining them. Hws are easy, midterms are perdy easy if you study(not even a whole lot)&I personally enjoyed attending class. For a GE or just to balance out workload you definitely should take this class.","rDate":"12/03/2013","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Low","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
