She made a very difficult subject easy to understand and gave good resources/ examples. The programming assignments are difficult but REALLY FUN! Also, DON'T CHEAT she takes that stuff very seriously (as one should). Overall a wonderful professor and probably my favorite at UCSC so far.

Assignments are fun but HARD! Start early.  There are quizzes on each section on eCommons (don't forget). The class doesn't get into the real interesting stuff, but is a good INTRO to AI.  Ask questions and talk to her if you are interested. We are lucky to have her.","rDate":"05/13/2016","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"N/A","rOverall":3.5,"rOverallString":"3.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"A","teacherRatingTags":["BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES","EXTRA CREDIT","Participation matters"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":26176488,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":3,"rClass":"CMPS140","rComments":"She is a nice teacher and very passionate about the subject. However, she did not spend enough time on topics during the end of the class, as a result the final was quite difficult as there were around 4 topics that we only spent 1 class period on. Other than that she did her best to offer extra credit for small things.","rDate":"03/23/2016","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"N/A","rOverall":3.5,"rOverallString":"3.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"B","teacherRatingTags":["EXTRA CREDIT","Tough Grader","Participation matters"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Mandatory","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":1,"id":26104129,"notHelpCount":1,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"CMPS140","rComments":"Interesting class with an interesting professor. The class itself isn't THAT time demanding except for the homework assignments, which can take upwards of 10 hours to finish. There are plenty of chances for extra credit and the class is curved, so doing well isn't impossible.","rDate":"03/02/2016","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"Yes","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":["EXTRA CREDIT","LOTS OF HOMEWORK"],"unUsefulGrouping":"person","usefulGrouping":"person"}]
