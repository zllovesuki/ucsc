Her examples are interesting. Its not a hard class, she basically gave everyone A's, even after getting a high C on the midterm.  FLASH CARDS and know the basics on the graphs.

You kind of expect a University professor to keep their students more engaged with current findings in the field, or examples from his/her personal research.
