He is always crystal clear, willing to repeat himself as needed and always open to questions. His humor was always refreshing since the class was at 8 am. Beware though, 90% of your grade comes from the midterm and final exams. He purposely designs the exams to be nearly impossible like law schools exams.","rDate":"03/17/2010","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
