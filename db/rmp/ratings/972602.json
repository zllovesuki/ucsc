But her class is pretty easy. I learned a lot about the traveling industry and about tourism. I feel like the Ideas and Details book was useless, (since I didn't need to read it), as well as some of the activities. She likes class participation.","rDate":"08/17/2010","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":3.5,"rOverallString":"3.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":15879330,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":4,"rClass":"WRIT2","rComments":"She's a cool person, but talks a lot.
