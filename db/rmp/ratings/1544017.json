Her lectures are confusing and not helpful with the homework, she has difficulty answering questions asked during lecture, says &quot;um&quot; every other word, and never seems to fully understand the material she is teaching. She initially submitted the wrong grade for me. On the plus side, midterms are easier than the practice exams.","rDate":"03/29/2011","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":2,"rInterest":"Low","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":18314478,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":3,"rClass":"PHYS6B","rComments":"Nice lady, but her lectures aren't very clear or helpful in regards to learning the material.
