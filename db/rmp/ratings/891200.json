Loves to rattle on about cultural history and hates it if you disagree with her or her films. She will hold a grudge & is very batty, easily amused & distracted. Doesn't explain class expectations well. The class is very easy, except for the week of the festival (8 films, 5 days, 3 locations, 0 content).","rDate":"11/07/2008","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Meh","rOverall":1,"rOverallString":"1.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
