But just cause it's easly doesn't mean it's lame.","rDate":"03/10/2005","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":3128879,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"MUSIC101B","rComments":"Miller is not forgiving, she failed more than half my class on a test and said we didn't learn material well enough.  However, she's very clear and was probably right.  Her classes were the best organized of any teacher I had at UCSC.
