She's one of the most approachable profs I've met at UCSC. Since it's a creative writing workshop class, her comments are sometimes more important than lectures. She's both critical and encouraging. Her classes aren't difficult to pass as long as you try hard, attend class and keep up with the reading.","rDate":"04/22/2011","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":15561465,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"LTCR52","rComments":"Melissa is the type of professor that every student deserves to have at least once.
