Take him if possible for ANY class. Some work obviously must be put in to get a grade but he helps A LOT. For example, for this class he put up videos explaining every homework question in case you got stuck. He is a very organized teacher and makes material fun and easy to learn.","rDate":"07/24/2014","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"person"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":23466751,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"ECON11A","rComments":"Genuinely one of the best classes I have taken.  Gabriel put considerable effort into the lectures and thoroughly enjoyed teaching.  He created numerous online youtube videos that helped explain the homework and the class material.  Tests were straightforward and fairly easy. Homework was optional, attendance was optional. Overall a great class!","rDate":"07/23/2014","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
