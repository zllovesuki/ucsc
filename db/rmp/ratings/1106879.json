Got to say it pretty tough taking Qiang over the summer because we cram through 2 or 4 chapter a day in that 4 hour class. Hard but it was worth it just to get stats out of the way. But overall if you take him during the school i recommend because its a lot easier and everyone can easy get a A.","rDate":"09/05/2011","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":18859726,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":4,"rClass":"PSYCH2","rComments":"I had him for summer session and he made the 4 hrs go by way faster.He cracks jokes, some lame, every couple of slides.He's realy helpful, but even more if he knows who you are.
