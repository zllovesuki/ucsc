No practice test, ridiculous exams, dumb extra assignments, NO CURVE and mostly she cannot teach; she literally repeats what is on the slides just with better grammar. I regret taking this class so much. Also, need a clicker, waste of money when there are cheaper/free options available for quizzes.","rDate":"03/19/2014","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":2,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Mandatory","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"average","helpCount":1,"id":22914324,"notHelpCount":2,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":4,"rClass":"BIOE20B","rComments":"Ready to have no life?

She tests heavily on her notes and things she happens to mention in class. Also when she gives an assignment, pay attention to it, she will test from assignments as well.
