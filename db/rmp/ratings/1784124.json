Julie made the class super interesting and entertaining. The midterms and final were mostly based off lectures and class videos. Besides the 3 exams, there's also a short 3 page paper on a primate of ur choice.","rDate":"04/06/2013","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Low","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":21476153,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"ANTH106","rComments":"Julie is an awesome professor! She creates a really engaging class environment and explains topics clearly. Her tests can be tricky but pay attention in lecture and study the slides and you're golden. I've taken three of her classes and LOVED each one.

She knows her stuff and she brings SO much to the lecture hall. More than just an hour and a half of notes. She makes jokes, laughs a lot, and is extremely passionate about her studies (she is a primatologist). I thoroughly enjoyed her class and made sure to tell her that after handing in my final.

She's very passionate and knowledgeable about her work. Her exams are very fair, but you should read the textbook to reinforce the material you learned in lecture. She's Canadian and uses the CANADIAN grading system, which is so much more forgiving than America's. Unfortunately, she's only a visiting scholar and is leaving.","rDate":"12/19/2012","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
