I am saddened that she only teachers 1-3, because I would love to have her through German 6. I highly recommend her. She is clear and thorough, and if you are confused her office hours really help and she is more than willing to make extra appointments.","rDate":"05/09/2014","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":22882550,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"GERM1","rComments":"I love Gabriella.

We spent 80% of class time just sitting around and doing practically nothing. She's very nice, and easy to get an A with, but you will NOT learn much German. If you want to work harder and really understand the language, take Campbell. Abrams is also really good, but Campbell's style is more effective.","rDate":"06/25/2013","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":2,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":1.5,"rOverallString":"1.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"person"}]
