Not great, not bad, just meh. He gives lots of extra credit and it's easy to catch up, but he doesn't really explain demos or his expectations of the class very well. He also speaks in a bit of a monotonic voice. It's only when he had a passion for the specific topic he taught where the lecture was more interesting to follow.","rDate":"05/04/2013","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Low","rOverall":3,"rOverallString":"3.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":21462075,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":3,"rClass":"PSYCH121","rComments":"Interesting topic. Great teaching skills. Short answer midterms and final. Easy to bring your grade up if you realize late you have to read the book to pass the tests.
