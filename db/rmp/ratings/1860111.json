Although, yes, she's very nice, nice doesn't cut it. Avoid taking this class with her! You teach yourself the entire class because you don't learn anything in her lectures; all she does is read off the slides.

She seems nice and is really chill with attendance/talking/sleeping, things that other professors are really uptight about. Her lecturing style could use work but as long as you do the homework its fine.

Don't be afraid to ask her a question. She wants to make sure everyone understands everything. We had 6 quizzes for the quarter but she drops 2.
