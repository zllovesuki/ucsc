We were told we wouldn't be graded in the class until the end, yet we always were. Her lectures were long and she just rambles to herself. No one really listens. She's extremely boring and non-engaging. I took this class as a C1 credit, however, it was much harder than expected.","rDate":"11/04/2015","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Low","rOverall":1.5,"rOverallString":"1.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":["LECTURE HEAVY","Get ready to read"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"person"}]
