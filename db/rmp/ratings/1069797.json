She's very conversational, likes to reach out. That bothers some who prefer the invisible wall lecturer. It was refreshing to hear somebody teach narrative structures instead of going on about identity politics and theory like other UCSC lit profs. Very into the craft of lit, she was. Very kind, warm, highly recommended.","rDate":"09/08/2010","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":15815808,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"WRIT2","rComments":"Great class, a lot of in class writing but not too difficult.
