Great class for 1st quarter of Freshman year. She's really cool and will introduce you to a wide range of thinking about things. The reading is interesting. The prompts can be a bit vague and sections were pretty unneccesary, but a nice end to the week. Overall cool prof, easy to get in touch with. A bit of an ego.","rDate":"03/06/2013","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":3.5,"rOverallString":"3.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":21309435,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"KRSG80B","rComments":"Dr. Carr teaches creative writing, and I benefited a lot from her perspective and teaching, but I also hated her class.
