Helps you out if you need it, especially in office hours.  However, his lectures are terrible.  They are all over the place.  He gets lost in his examples and seems to always make mistakes which throws off the flow of the class.  HIs tests are doable but this class is rough.","rDate":"12/09/2011","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":2.5,"rOverallString":"2.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
