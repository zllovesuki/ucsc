I'm taking Social Networks with him (don't be fooled by the name, it's a math class). His lectures are a little dry but he's pretty clear and very fair. There are weekly homeworks which are medium difficulty, but if you do those then the tests will be pretty easy. His tests are all multiple choice with no trick Qs.","rDate":"05/02/2016","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"N/A","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"Not sure yet","teacherRatingTags":["LOTS OF HOMEWORK","Clear grading criteria"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":26171283,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"CMPS182","rComments":"Solid professor.
