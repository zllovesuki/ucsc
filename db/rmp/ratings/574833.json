Unfortunately he has little or no criteria by which he bases his evaluations of his students, and accordingly grading by Mr. Spagnolo is purely subjective.  If you're one of those kids who can pretend to be interested in a vague, off topic, unfocussed, boring and under researched lecture then you will undoubtedly receive an A (you need not even turn in a final if he likes you enough).
