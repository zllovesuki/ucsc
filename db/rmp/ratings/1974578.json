She doesn't rely on powerpoints to expand on the readings and she adds context and expands on the assigned readings.  No tests, just a midterm paper/powerpoint and a final project or paper. Ruiz is passionate about what she is teaching which makes all the difference.","rDate":"02/18/2016","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"A-","teacherRatingTags":["Get ready to read","Amazing lectures"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Mandatory","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"good","helpCount":3,"id":24356211,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"FILM80S","rComments":"A very easy and fun film class to take. Not many assignments and no tests. She's really nice and easy to talk to. It's a class about animation but she doesn't grade you on artistic ability, she grades on effort.","rDate":"02/03/2015","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"A","teacherRatingTags":["Respected","Clear grading criteria"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"good","helpCount":3,"id":24252172,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"FILM80S","rComments":"Professor Ruiz taught the History of Animation and it was by far one of the best and easiest classes I've ever taken. She's really kind and flexible on assignments. The course was not difficult, as her lectures were interesting and aided with visuals. There are no tests - a final research paper, a presentation, a flipbook, and some weekly posts.","rDate":"01/08/2015","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
