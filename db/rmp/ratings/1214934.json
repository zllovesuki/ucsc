The only problem I had was that I really wish he could have made a variety of song choices. Every song we sang was in Spanish. Other than that, he is a no nonsense type of teacher but the class isn't a lot of hard work. It just requires a lot of time.","rDate":"05/16/2009","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":15370951,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"MUSIC1C","rComments":"If you can read music semi-well and keep a tune, you NEED to audition for Concert Choir.  Beautiful music and very fun. Nat is everything you could want in a director -- nice, funny, clear, diplomatic, and never humiliates or puts people down.  It was my first choir experience and I had a blast, as did experienced singers.","rDate":"01/14/2009","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
