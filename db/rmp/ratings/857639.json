No section and plenty of reading. If you can push through the first half of the quarter, past the classical and experimental, you'll do wonderfully. Two easy as pie papers and your usual midterm/final with listening questions. DO THE LISTENING AND THE READING!!!

Lots of reading, if you go to class and pay attention you dont have to do more than skim the reading.  Great pianist and knowlege of musical terms and their application.
