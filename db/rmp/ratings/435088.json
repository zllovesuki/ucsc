Unfortunately he is a horrible lecturer. His lectures are boring and make most people stop showing up after the first couple of weeks. In addition, he makes his exams extremely difficult. He will assign certain questions on the homework and then the exam questions will not reflect what you practiced.","rDate":"03/27/2013","rEasy":5,"rEasyString":"5.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":1,"rOverallString":"1.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Not Mandatory","clarityColor":"poor","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"poor","helpCount":0,"id":10481907,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awful","rClarity":1,"rClass":"EE135","rComments":"No Comments","rDate":"09/10/2005","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":1,"rOverallString":"1.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"INC","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"poor","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"poor","helpCount":0,"id":2458791,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awful","rClarity":1,"rClass":"EE88","rComments":"this guy is bad, insults students during presentations, is not helpful, too much work for a 1 credit class. more work than any of my 5 credit classes. he is a jerk. stay away if you can","rDate":"09/09/2004","rEasy":5,"rEasyString":"5.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"N/A","rOverall":1,"rOverallString":"1.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"poor","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"poor","helpCount":0,"id":2325817,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awful","rClarity":1,"rClass":"EE88A","rComments":"This class was a 1 credit class.
