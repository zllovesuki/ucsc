Her class was amazing and she had a few guest lecturers; all of which were great!!! Her tests are pretty easy and all you really need to know are the main points which she discusses in class and for the final she gives a study guide. HIGHLY RECOMMEND HER CLASS!

The required projects are loosely defined and assigned groups are frustrating. In lecture only takes quotes from the reading.

The material she teaches is super interesting and her lectures are really eye opening and fun... She does have reading but you don't have to buy a textbook and the readings are really interesting!
