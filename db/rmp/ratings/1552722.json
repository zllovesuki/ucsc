The class is taught with pretentiousness and the subjects are often irrelevant.

I had to teach myself. She didn't go over it in class. The kind of stuff we cover is, at least to me, very pretentious to the point of stupidity. I'm not enjoying this class. If you like interpreting stuff in ways the author probably didn't intend, you'll like it. I found myself lost and annoyed.
