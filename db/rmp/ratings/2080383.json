We did not have a midterm or final, just 4 quizzes that were 30 multiple choice questions and you could have an 8X11 'cheat sheet' (handwritten or typed). We had 5 essays, that were only 2 pages long (one was 5, but it's a group paper). Over all good class that prepares you for the ENVS major","rDate":"03/09/2016","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":["Inspirational","Caring"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"person"}]
