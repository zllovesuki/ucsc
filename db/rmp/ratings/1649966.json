He's really nice and all the work is just busy work, he doesn't give letter grades but checks on papers. He's more interested in teaching you to think differently and opening new writing styles up, and allowing you to explore. Journal entries on every reading but you can B.S and just participate a lot!

If you're the kind of person who is obsessed with grades you won't like Steve - he doesn't give grades on papers, but rather gives really helpful comments. Listen to what he says and revise accordingly, and you'll probs be fine.
