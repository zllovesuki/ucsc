If you stay on top of the reading and go to lectures you'll do well. His class is fair and those that don't think so didn't put the necessary time into this upper division class.

Going into the class I wasn't sure what to expect, but he was hilarious from the get go. Saxton is the homie! Cell bio is tough you have to put in the effort still of course. His personality makes you want to go to his class to see what goofiness he has in store.

Overall, Bill did a great job at teaching this course! He's real fun and enthusiastic about the material. One downfall is the ENORMOUS amount of reading required. Bill teaches you a general outline, but reading is absolutely necessary. Get ready to read, read, read people!

Although his lectures can sometimes get monotonous, he always know show to bring the mood right back. The class itself is structured as a 'cap-stone' class so he gives you a lot of autonomy when it comes to completing assignments and participating in class. Exams are very fair.
