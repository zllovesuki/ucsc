Ted is very  nice, if you take the time to talk to him outside the class he can be a very interesting person. He knows this stuff very well and give his teaching a major priority.

He helped to transform my movement that I have been developing from a young age. If there is one dance class to take at UCSC it's any class with Ted!

Has a very impressive background. Extremely patient, innovative, and helpful. Very observant and engaging in class. Expects a lot from his students.
