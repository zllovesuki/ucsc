The lectures were unintelligible, the prof is unclear, and almost NOBODY goes to class... the only reason I learned anything was through my TA! He was very unclear about what was going to be on the final, and I felt so understudied.. but I got a B in the class and on the final, so you have to give him credit for being fair/easy on the students, I guess.","rDate":"09/15/2005","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Low","rOverall":1,"rOverallString":"1.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":3913029,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"poor","rClarity":2,"rClass":"MATH23A","rComments":"Most unengaging teacher I have EVER had.
