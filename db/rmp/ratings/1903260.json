Readings are boring! Uses slideshows during lectures  but what she says is more important than what is on the slides. The class felt more like a history class than anything else.

Election was amazing, very cool material, easy midterm and papers if you actually payed attention in class. ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS WRITE DOWN EVERYTHING SHE SAYS IN CLASS! You can easy do both papers based on her lectures. 120 was disappointing, boring material.

I heard she is a hard grader, but I got my essay revised a few times (for free, on campus and by peers) and received a high A. In my opinion, your grade reflects how much effort you apply. WARNING: She doesn't put her slides up online and she talks quite fast. Don't hesitate to tell her to repeat something.","rDate":"07/14/2014","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Mandatory","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":23392599,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"poor","rClarity":3,"rClass":"POLI120B","rComments":"Tough Class. She's a super tough grader and not very helpful. She's looking for very specific things in your writing and you HAVE to buy into it. The TA grades everything except the final paper.
