Here lectures are kind of boring and there are no sections (which actually would have been helpful).  No midterms or final either--just 2 papers, and she grades kind of hard on them.  All in all, boring but not unbarable.","rDate":"06/09/2005","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Meh","rOverall":3,"rOverallString":"3.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":2606779,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"LING105","rComments":"This was an awesome class! The textbook was really dull, but the classes made it all seem fun, and her enthusiasm was really motivating. The problems were difficult - it's not an easy course - but she was really helpful and her explanations were really clear. I'd def. take another course from her.","rDate":"10/27/2004","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
