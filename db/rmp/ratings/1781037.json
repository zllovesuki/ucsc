He is so intelligent and helpful. I learned so much in his course and got a good grade.  He's not down for more than two absences, so you have to go to class, but it is definitely worth it.

He definitely wants you to be a part of a discussion, rather than sitting listening to him lecture. He gave ample opportunity to redo assignments, but he also expected very high intellectual standards. His courses aren't reading heavy, but you need to read what is assigned.","rDate":"05/02/2013","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":21046816,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"LTEL170C","rComments":"Professor Keilen is fantastic!!
