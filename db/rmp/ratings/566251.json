I went into this class thinking I would hate physics but he explains things in such a way that makes complete sense. He is very passionate about teaching and really wants his students to understand physics. His reviews and exams are straightforward and fair.","rDate":"02/02/2006","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Low","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":10480786,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"PHYSICS6B","rComments":"enthusiastic, goes out of his way to make students understand Physics (he provides multiple review sessions to accomodate people who couldn't make it...THAT'S AWESOME!)...Exams were very straightforward.","rDate":"09/10/2005","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":3512754,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"PHYS6B","rComments":"He has a somewhat annoying speaking style, which put me off at first, but once you get used to him he's great.
