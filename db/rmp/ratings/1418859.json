Lectures are oftentimes cut short, which is a plus, but I often get the feeling that she doesn't enjoy lecturing. She always seemed rushed and uninterested in the topics at hand. TA was unhelpful and a slow/harsh grader. Do well on all work, don't expect any freebies.","rDate":"04/06/2011","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":2.5,"rOverallString":"2.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":18238319,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"FMST126","rComments":"It was a small class, so a bit intimidating at first but she was super helpful and encouraging.
