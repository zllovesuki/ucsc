Sommer is a good dancer, but came off a little uptight and not very approachable. also all the yoga in the class is done wrong, which was a little annoying.","rDate":"05/22/2008","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":14286905,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"TA31C","rComments":"SOMMER ROCKS!!! She pushes you until you have aches and pains, but you always grow in her class. Even if you're not the best dancer, she always challenges her students in an awesome way.
