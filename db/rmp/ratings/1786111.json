I'm astonished by how much information she spits out! She is knowledgeable in a wide range of subjects and every time I asked her a question about my project, she was able to provide me with a lot of helpful information, all generated from her head. Amazing!

She is passionate about helping and connecting with the students and would sit with me after class to discuss more than just my studies and helped me so much! Its a shame that she will not be here next year, the school is losing a huge asset in my opinion.","rDate":"02/19/2013","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":21223754,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"ECON197","rComments":"Most helpful and nicest professor here.","rDate":"01/07/2013","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Low","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":21147440,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"ECON197","rComments":"Judy is a wonderful professor. The class is seminar styled where you read the assigned book and have mandatory discussion in class. But she goes off on tangents often. There are short papers every week and a large paper at the end. Very enjoyable overall.","rDate":"12/21/2012","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
