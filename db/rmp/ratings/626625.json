You will learn a lot even if you don't put any effort in, and he doesn't require much in terms of reading.  Take him if you want an easy class but still want to learn about Mexican politics from a liberal viewpoint.","rDate":"12/07/2005","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":3935670,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"poor","rClarity":2,"rClass":"LALS80D","rComments":"He's a nice guy.
