She manages to scare you into doing more than the limit, which I find to be so great because you'll come out with some of the greatest works from her class. She is so funny and she's really understanding. I highly recommend taking her class if you want to test yourself.","rDate":"03/30/2012","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":10804253,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"INTAGLIO","rComments":"Jimin requires a lot from you, but understands your abilities and limitations. She will push you to do your best at all times, and doesn't let you get away with doing anything half-way. You will learn a lot in her classes, and produce some excellent work. Despite not always knowing the correct english word for what she's trying to say, she has fun and interesting ways of getting her point accross that are never unclear.  All around excellent teacher!","rDate":"10/23/2005","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":1303310,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"ART026","rComments":"She seems uptight at first but she's actually a lot of fun.
