If you show an interest in subjects related to her class, she will educate you as much as she can (which is a lot) and give you further references to learn more on  your own. She's incredibly intelligent and although has strong opinions, I realized her thoughts on prejudice/race/gender were spot on.","rDate":"03/04/2009","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":15374267,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"KRSG80B","rComments":"Kate Schatz is an inspiration! She is definitely a hardass, but it is 100% worth it. She is awesomely sarcastic and will let you know if you're being an idiot.

Professional, knowledgeable and very on top of her game- she is both writer and publisher. I felt like I was in the right hands.
