Fandom and Geek Culture was the best class ever, mostly because she is the most enthusiastic, riveting lecturer ever. Seriously. So much fun to listen to. Her class was set up really nicely, too. Not too many assignments, so I felt like I was just kind of floating along a river of learning on a nice summer day.","rDate":"06/07/2011","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":18333914,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":4,"rClass":"FILM187","rComments":"Very helpful, cares about subject matter.  Teaches some of the best upper division film courses.  Only downside is that some of the subject matter feels irrelevant to what you're trying to learn.
