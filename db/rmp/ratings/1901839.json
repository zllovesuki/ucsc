Class is discussion based and you will need to participate, but the discussions are always fun - often about music, TV, etc. If you go to office hours, he will read over your papers and give you feedback. You can also revise any papers for the portfolio. Honest, Chuck is my favorite professor at SC.","rDate":"06/12/2015","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":["Participation matters","Gives good feedback","Respected"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Mandatory","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":3,"id":23253061,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"WRIT2","rComments":"Chuck is an awesome! His topic for writing2 is \"The History of Cool\" and it was so interesting. He is really helpful and gives great feedback while actually listening to what you have to say. Finally found a professor that doesn't grade essays for whether he agrees with your opinion or not.
