Really cared about his students. I was so sad to hear that he wasn't going to teach the class after I took it. If he's still teaching at UCSC: get in his class. You won't regret it. He is very helpful, clear to follow, and if you follow the steps he gives you, I'm sure you'll pass. There was a textbook, but we never used it.","rDate":"05/19/2015","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":["Amazing lectures","LOTS OF HOMEWORK","Gives good feedback"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":24326444,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":4,"rClass":"MATH2","rComments":"He was a pretty good teacher.

He made my first college math experience a great one by being so helpful& you can see his passion shine through his teachings and lectures. He can easily relate to his students, you can tell he genuinely cares about his students& wants each and everyone to pass.

His teaching style is so clear and easy to understand. He is a very fair grader and gives you the grade you deserve. Easy to talk to and entertaining.

I thought the class would be boring at 8pm but no this guy has a lot of energy. He is very clear on the topics and he encourages you to ask question. My favorite professor so far.
