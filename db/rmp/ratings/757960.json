He is very understanding--I was a total screw-up during the quarter I took his class, and he was nothing but encouraging. Very knowledgeable about painting styles, good demos, good at helping develop individual styles. He lets you get on with your work in your own way. Not challenging but supportive.","rDate":"03/16/2008","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":13781935,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":4,"rClass":"ART103","rComments":"Frank's class is very laid-back.  The students are pretty much in charge of the critiques, except that he'll call on you when you don't necessarily have anything to say.  He won't talk to you very much unless you come in on weekends and he happens to be there or you initiate the conversation.  He teaches the class differently each quarter.","rDate":"12/09/2007","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":12971000,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"ART102","rComments":"Frank knows everything in the subjects he teaches.

As a teacher, I didn't enjoy him.  He never gave feedback, would leave the room for long periods of time, and would have few critiques (often lead by students).  If he did participate in critiques, they would rarely be about the quality of the work, but rather an abstract discussion about artistic concepts.","rDate":"05/19/2006","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":1.5,"rOverallString":"1.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":11455790,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"ART","rComments":"Frank, is an awesome teacher.
