Good books, heavy workload, but get a good TA and it won't matter. Her lectures are painful to listen to, however, being long  with no break and nothing but Freud and Lacan. She's pretty funny, though, and will answer questions.","rDate":"11/23/2007","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":2.5,"rOverallString":"2.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":13676221,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":3,"rClass":"LTMO180B","rComments":"She has a good reading list, but she only does physco-analysis which gets really boring after you hear it for about five texts. She also speaks over students. The class isen't that hard. Just kinda repetitive. If you like reading gothic text and having absurd readings of the text and then identifying the characters others-thats also does.

She goes very in depth into her readings of the material, and it can get metaphorical.  I give you this advice: don't  use a tape recorder; you can easily keep up if you can type quicklyon a laptop.  This does have a TON of reading and requires lit experience/talent.","rDate":"10/28/2006","rEasy":5,"rEasyString":"5.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":12186941,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":4,"rClass":"LTEL180","rComments":"very interesting course, but Moglen lectures almost more than is physically possible to write down. Very knowledgable and insightful, but bring a tape recorder if you can. Heavy reading load, don't take it lightly read everything. Highly recommended if you can keep up with her :)","rDate":"08/24/2006","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":3.5,"rOverallString":"3.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
