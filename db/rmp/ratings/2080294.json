Her class on Dante's Divine Comedy was incredible and I actually paid attention to her lectures because they were so interesting. She's so passionate about the subject that she makes you passionate about it as well. If she's teaching a class you owe it to yourself to take it because she's amazing.","rDate":"05/04/2016","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"N/A","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"Yes","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":["Inspirational","Amazing lectures"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":1,"id":26088307,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"LTPR183","rComments":"I love Elisabeth Coggeshall. Before her class I not only knew nothing about Dante, I knew nothing about medieval Europe in general. Leaving Beths class I not only understood these subjects, but found a deep appreciation for Dante, Medieval Literature, and I found a greater understanding of Christianity as a whole. 10/10 Fantastic professor.","rDate":"02/25/2016","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"Yes","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"A-","teacherRatingTags":["Amazing lectures","Respected"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"person"},{"attendance":"Mandatory","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":25594177,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"LRPR183","rComments":"Beth's a really cool teacher, she's very passionate about Dante and all things literature. Her tests were tricky at first but she gave the class a way to get more points by writing an additional optional essay. I wasn't too excited about the material but she made class funny and entertaining. I'm very happy to have her as a teacher :) ","rDate":"12/08/2015","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":["Caring","Inspirational","Get ready to read"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
