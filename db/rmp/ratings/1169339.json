Her notes are great, and she is able to teach Calculus in a way that makes it understandable. She is also helpful, creating workshops for the trickier topics. Plus she is upbeat & funny, and creates a positive relationship with her students.  Plus she is easy on the eyes. :) I highly recommend this professor.","rDate":"09/30/2008","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Low","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":14766402,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"MATH11A","rComments":"Megan is a great teacher.  She made calculus easy to understand, and I am not a math person at all.  Go to lectures and office hours, and do the homework and you will be fine.  She is very approachable and helpful and will stop and explain things during class if you don't understand. All around a great teacher.","rDate":"08/22/2008","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Low","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
