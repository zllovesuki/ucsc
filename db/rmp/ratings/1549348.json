Lectures vids are online.  Programming assignments are reasonable--read wikis and you'll understand everything.  You've got weeks and weeks to finish everything.  Crowdgrading system is innovative and weird, but you typically get good marks if the class is nice.

He covers almost no information in lecture, and you will probably stop going. His homework is incredibly undemanding (1-2 hrs / week), and his tests are easy. But read the book for his tests, just knowing how to code wont cut it. You'll have to know terminology you'll only find in the textbook.","rDate":"03/15/2011","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":3,"rOverallString":"3.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
