There are very few teachers i have been able to say i DIDNT LIKE at ucsc, and she is one of them.  While she claimed she wanted you to think for yourself, she became thoroughly upset when anyone presented a different opinion.  I felt like because i thought for myself, my writing was marked down.  Everyone seems to love her, and im really not sure why...","rDate":"09/23/2005","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Low","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Mandatory","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":10371164,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"AMERPHILO","rComments":"Really expects a lot, and knows how to make you want to produce it.
