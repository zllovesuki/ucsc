This class is very interesting but fast paced. If you do not study everyday you will not grasp the concepts. But all in all it is a really good class to take if you are serious about learning the language. :]","rDate":"02/19/2009","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":12959393,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":4,"rClass":"ITAL1A","rComments":"I took the Intense Italian Class, so it moves really fast, but Teresa made it as clear and fun as possible. I am not a morning person and I had Italian  at 9:30 am so I was not necessarily in a good mood when I got to class. She was so bubbly and energetic that I would actually wake up and enjoy class. My favorite part was singing songs in class!","rDate":"04/01/2007","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":12839176,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"ITAL1A","rComments":"Teresa is a great! She teaches the accelerated Italian course, originally a Cabrillo teacher.Teaches the class in all Italian, immersion style.This class goes F-A-S-T. Don't take unless youre prepared to REALLY study. I took this class twice, failed the first time,loved it the second time. She's so funny and very helpful in office hours.
