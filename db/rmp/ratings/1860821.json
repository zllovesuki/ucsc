Li follows the book and his notes are very organized. His quizzes are from lecture and the exams are hard but fair if you do the homework. He curves at the end and he is available to help when he is asked. He takes time out of class to explain concepts in class when asked. Very interesting class. Work hard and you will pass!","rDate":"02/10/2014","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":22591586,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":4,"rClass":"CHEM163A","rComments":"Teaches straight from the textbook, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. English is not his first language but he'll try to explain confusing concepts as best he can when asked. He's also very approachable after class and in his office hours. Assignments and exams were fair. Great instructor overall for an intense course.","rDate":"12/17/2013","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
