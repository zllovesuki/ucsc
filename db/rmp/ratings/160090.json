He doesn't just want you to learn the material and then use it verbatim, you are required to apply it which means you need to be adaptable while taking the test.  He threw a curveball question on the final that was on material covered 4 days before the final.  I would wait for someone else.","rDate":"01/05/2006","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Mandatory","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":11062786,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":4,"rClass":"11AAND11B","rComments":"wants students to do well but lacks the ability to communicate effectively with his students for some reason, i think a grad school class at a good uni. would help him tremendously, overall a good duy though and VERY FUNNY","rDate":"12/06/2005","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"C-","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":10955814,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"11A11B","rComments":"He is a very good teacher.

I would always get 2/10 on homeworks because I didn't fully understand the material by the due date but by the time the midterms and final came up he made it all very clear.  Ended up failing all homeworks and getting A's on the tests giving me a grade of B.
