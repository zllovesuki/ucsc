He pretends to care about students but really puts in minimal effort. On his essays, he only marked me and my friends down for grammar issues and only seemed to grade the front page of the essay. When I asked how to improve from my B essay, he only showed me 3 places where I made grammatical errors.","rDate":"06/24/2016","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"N/A","rOverall":1,"rOverallString":"1.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"No","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"D-","teacherRatingTags":["GRADED BY FEW THINGS"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Mandatory","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":26128747,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":3,"rClass":"CORE80A","rComments":"Palter expects a lot from a student. Every class, expect to give a reading response and make sure you participate in every discussion. Unless you work your ass off, don't expect an easy A. There's always an essay per week and he expects each essay to be better than the last. He was pretty cool at first but expects way too much critical thinking.","rDate":"03/09/2016","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":3,"rOverallString":"3.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"B+","teacherRatingTags":["LOTS OF HOMEWORK","Get ready to read","Tough Grader"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
