Good books. She was incredibly sweet but class was boring. Very factual and she doesn't leave much room for theory. You read a book, class covers the plot and facts about the author and a few themes. Book load keeps you on your feet, but is pleasurable, just right. She could have done better with lectures, made them more interesting.","rDate":"12/14/2010","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":3.5,"rOverallString":"3.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":17863918,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"poor","rClarity":2,"rClass":"LTEL102D","rComments":"Strong Marxist-feminist political ideology throughout class went unidentified.

She provides a clear syllabus and follows it. So whatever you may do wrong is simply your own fault. The class requires a lot of reading.
