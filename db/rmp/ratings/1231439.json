Did a lot of hands on projects which was nice. He didn't lecture a whole lot, but when he did he was very clear. The TA was really no help, so if you have questions/concerns, don't be afraid to talk to him. He's  approachable and helpful. There are a lot of group assignments, an essay, and an open-book final.","rDate":"03/07/2010","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
