I walked into the class not remembering any Chinese and with her and Keenan's help, I can read 80% of books and guess the rest.

She's really nice if you talk to her. Of course she's strict, makes you actually learn. Do your homework and be nice throughout the course, it'll help bump you up if you do bad on the final.
