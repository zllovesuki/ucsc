Not the easiest class, and he needs to get better at writing tests that aren't about little tiny details, but I learned a lot. There's often a long line for his office hours, partly because he's so nice and approachable.

He's actively engaged in the field, teaches law at Vermont, will definitely make you laugh (at least chuckle) every lecture, and although being the most intimidating prof at ucsc (for me), is totally approachable when you reach out.","rDate":"02/04/2011","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
