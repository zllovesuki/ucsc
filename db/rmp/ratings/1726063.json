She jams large amounts of info into a slide and only briefly talks about it. Hardly able to get info down (three characters tops). Also lists unimportant info she says wont be on test. Very boring. If I wanted to see a blur of words for 2hrs I'd put a movie with subs on and fast forward. Do not take. Class will piss you off.","rDate":"05/22/2012","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":2,"rInterest":"Meh","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"person"}]
