He has spent over 40 years working in the Environmental Assessment system he is teaching. It is my opinion that he is far too entrenched in this system to adequately teach it to a layman. He does a very poor job of communicating what is important to learn. Awful class.","rDate":"04/26/2015","rEasy":5,"rEasyString":"5.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":2,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":1.5,"rOverallString":"1.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":21353489,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"ENVS151","rComments":"ANDY IS FANTASTIC.
