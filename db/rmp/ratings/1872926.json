It was pretty easy and the massive curve made it an easy A. There were a lot of really dumb people in the class who complained about the exams being \"super hard\" and whatnot but the tests were simple multiple choice. The only downside to Dr. Anderson is that she talks way to fast, BUT,she will repeat things if asked.","rDate":"04/29/2014","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"A+","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Not Mandatory","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":22998208,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"poor","rClarity":2,"rClass":"OCEA80B","rComments":"She is an extremely kind and genuine person and very passionate about the ocean.

She talks so fast in lecture it's almost pointless to take notes but she uploads the powerpoints anyways. Twice when I asked for help she directed me to the TAs. Easy class for me but I know some that struggled.
