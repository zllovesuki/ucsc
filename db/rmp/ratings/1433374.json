Insane curve, I pulled an A- as a freshman, so if you are upperclass men, then Shastry will be fine.","rDate":"10/25/2014","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":2.5,"rOverallString":"2.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"A-","teacherRatingTags":["Tough Grader"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":22288089,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"PHYSICS","rComments":"Great Professor, extremely helpful.
