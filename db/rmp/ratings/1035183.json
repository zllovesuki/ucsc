She motivated me to try hard and accel at a time when I was hating school. It's true, she can be tough, but it's only because she's old school, and she's actually a wonderful person. In one word, she's a professional.","rDate":"07/09/2010","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":14465975,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"JAPN004","rComments":"Konomi-Sensei was really nice and always willing to help out students.  She explained things very clearly, although memorizing the dialogs was a little tedious, it helped you remember the material, she was also pretty cool if u didn't do it either.  She was also very prompt in returning my email with the material I missed when I was sick.

You memorize the dialogues and the subject material before class and contribute, otherwise your grade will suffer. Homework due almost daily.
