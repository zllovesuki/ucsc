Seems to have had no teaching experience at all and has little, if any, command of the classroom. Stumbles every other sentence (even though she reads directly from powerpoint slides) and has a grating voice. Extremely unorganized. It is very painful to sit through her lectures.","rDate":"05/16/2008","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Meh","rOverall":1,"rOverallString":"1.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
