He's very serious about figure painting, so I suggest you don't clown around in this class. This, however, will be rewarding because you will learn a lot from this talented professor if you pay attention.

My work improved a lot, as did everyone else's in the class.  He didnt give enough critique though.","rDate":"06/22/2006","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
