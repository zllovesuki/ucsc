He was attentive to his students needs, including emailing me when I was sick to make sure I was okay, and his office hours were very informative. I wish he was a full professor so I could take more classes with him as the professor, not just the TA.","rDate":"08/12/2015","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"Yes","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"A-","teacherRatingTags":["Caring","Amazing lectures"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Mandatory","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":5,"id":24246739,"notHelpCount":1,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"105A","rComments":"Andrew is awesome! He always helps with any and all questions you have.  He does an excellent job of explaining course materials in depth, and helps you to apply it to real world situations.  He is by far the best TA at UCSC.  You can go to him for anything.  Super nice and never makes you feel inadequate in a given subject area.
