You watch a new film every class, it's a cool course. Had three papers, you have to incorporate the readings into them, was not too bad as I barely read.

In class, we watch the films and discuss the film. Sounds easy right? She barely lectures on terms, unorganized lectures, and doesn't really cover the theoretical concepts. You will get frustrated during her lectures. It does not seem she has teaching/lecturing experience.
