She knows her subject extremely well, considering this is the first time she has taught this class.  The readings for the class are a bit abstract and hard to follow at times, as well as time consuming.  Also, her explanation of assignments can be vague.  Other than that, great teacher and interesting class.","rDate":"02/07/2006","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
