Camilla is awesome, she is a genius and is very inspirational and approachable. Taking this class has cemented my desire to go into the stem cell field. Key to get an A: go to all classes, print out the lecture notes before class and write down everything she says. Tests are very fair if you study hard. Great guest lectures too!

I wish she had taught me all of my upper-div bio classes. Extremely caring and helpful individual, not to mention she is a complete genius.   BME 178 requires work, only the elite bio undergrads of UCSC take this class.  Most were involved with research, I'm sure the majority of the class got A's.

Definitely go to class, because she'll go over data for experiments that are tough to interpret without an explanation the first couple time. Super nice.

She posts everything online and is very approachable. This class is unlike any other biology lecture offered because your grade is NOT solely based off the midterm and final but also pop quizzes, presentations, and papers.
