He will show you the often depressing level of corruption within our government. He'll teach you cynicism and won't dumb anything down for you, but he is also extremely inspirational and will make you feel as though you have a purpose in society. Amazing teacher.","rDate":"03/29/2013","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
