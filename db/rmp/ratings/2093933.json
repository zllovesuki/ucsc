Tests and quizzes are easy; homeworks are incredibly hard, and you should absolutely go to TA sections. She is however really bad at getting grades back-took us 'til week 9 to get our midterms back, and she's consistently late submitting final grades.

She clearly wants her students to pass the class and her exams are clear cut and to the point, easy A if you study the slides.
