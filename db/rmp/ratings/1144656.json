It is really hard to understand what he says during lecture, the worst part is there are no e-commons or  power points to try to follow. The final is an unknown topic all we know is we must know ALL of the readings and lecture notes there are no guidelines and is an in class exam.

No, the class isn't easy, but if you are sick of not getting your money's worth out of Santa Cruz, then this class is for you.

Also a very difficult one. His lectures were great. You had to pay constant attention to do well, and that included staying on top of the readings. If you like a challenge, take this class. If you don't, but are interested in foreign policy, i'd take advantage and take his course.
