He is not open to new ideas from his students.","rDate":"05/08/2006","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":1,"rOverallString":"1.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"poor","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"poor","helpCount":0,"id":11201881,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awful","rClarity":1,"rClass":"CMPS201","rComments":"If you want to kill any passion you may have for algorithms go to his class.His exams are a test of how well you crammed the sample exam.There is a certain meanness in his grading.I believe he knows a lot but I suspect he is just not intrested in teaching.I think the whole excercise is equally painful to him as it is to the students.","rDate":"12/18/2005","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":1,"rOverallString":"1.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Mandatory","clarityColor":"poor","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"poor","helpCount":0,"id":3510652,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awful","rClarity":1,"rClass":"CMPS101","rComments":"I hated this class with a passion, I got lucky with a grade of a B.
