I was worried about taking stats since AP Stats was difficult for me, but he made the material easy and my TA was great. Bought the textbook but never opened it. He was a very nice person and I highly recommend this course.

He's the one prof I've ever had who truly encourages questions, loves feedback, connects with the students, and actually communicates the information perfectly. He emphasizes understanding concepts & really *learning* the material. He is absolutely the best prof I have ever had, hands down.","rDate":"04/29/2016","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"N/A","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"A+","teacherRatingTags":["Amazing lectures","Caring","Inspirational"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Not Mandatory","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"good","helpCount":2,"id":26184742,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"PSYC2","rComments":"Professor Dahl was by far one of the top 3 teachers I've had in MY LIFE. The man is enthusiastic, clear, and teaches with a purpose. It's clear that he is passionate about his subject and encourages students to ask questions and participate.

He posts the lecture slides online however, so if you don't go its no big deal. There's a lot of extra credit opportunities (tests are 120/100 etc). The course material is pretty easy, especially if you've taken AP Stats before, as I did.
