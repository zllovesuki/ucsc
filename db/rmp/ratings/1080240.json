Worse of all, he was 30 min late for final because he FORGOT to prepare them in advance.","rDate":"05/30/2009","rEasy":5,"rEasyString":"5.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":2,"rInterest":"Meh","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":14813052,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"poor","rClarity":2,"rClass":"ECON101","rComments":"First impression of his face is &quot;messy&quot;, which did reflect on his teaching styles. His class is completely disorganized: random homework given and no review guides for midterms, not to mention he was 30-min late for final cuz he forgot to print exam questions. His speech is poor and has &quot;severe&quot; technical difficult with machine in class.

Midterms were unannounced at the beginning of the quarter, and you don't find out til that week. He was not very helpful on the final paper topic and didn't give specific instructions.
