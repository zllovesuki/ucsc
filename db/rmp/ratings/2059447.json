Programming assignments were straight forward and not too code intensive although python was very new to me while theory assignments required a lot of thought. Midterm/final were both difficult. You could bring all your notes and more but even then it was hard.

He knows his stuff, he's passionate about his stuff, and he knows how to teach the material to students with varying levels of computer science exposure. Go to lectures! Unlike many professors in the department, he doesn't put you to sleep. His course requires effort but by the end of it, you will know your stuff too.","rDate":"06/03/2016","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"N/A","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"Yes","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":["ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","Inspirational","Amazing lectures"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"person"},{"attendance":"Not Mandatory","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":2,"id":26638100,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"CMPS101","rComments":"hard class but I've learned a lot from sesh, one of the better professors in computer science here","rDate":"05/23/2016","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"N/A","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":["EXTRA CREDIT","Gives good feedback","Tough Grader"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Not Mandatory","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":2,"id":26599088,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"CMPS101","rComments":"Sesh is a great lecturer who isn't afraid to draw out all the concepts by hand until students stop having questions. His life's work at age 30 is just down right impressive. Take him if you can.  He'll throw a bunch of stuff at you at once, but his goal is to prepare you for Silicon Valley. He'll even go through interview questions.","rDate":"05/17/2016","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"N/A","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":["Caring","EXTRA CREDIT","Tough Grader"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":3,"id":26495989,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"CMPS101","rComments":"Really really amazing.
