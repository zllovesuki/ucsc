He really knows his material and it comes out when he teaches. He uses demonstrations almost every class. He's kind of bad at answering questions in lecture but people ask stupid ones usually anyway. If you do the homework, go to lecture (iclickers count), and study a few hours for each test you'll get an A.","rDate":"03/15/2011","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":16569916,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":2,"rClass":"PHYS105","rComments":"Spends a bit too much time doing algebra on the board rather than explaining concepts. His grading system is fair, but its not as easy to get an A as in some other courses. Assigns homework problems that require way too much algebra, although maybe this is just the nature of this course. Quizes and final were straight forward and fair.
