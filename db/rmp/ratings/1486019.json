It was supposed to be intro, but he assumed that we had previous knowledge about the material.  The online hw didn't correlate with the book or lecture notes and the tests were very difficult.  A lot of unnecessary math & physics and very little material about the actual universe.","rDate":"03/06/2011","rEasy":5,"rEasyString":"5.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":2,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":2.5,"rOverallString":"2.5","rStatus":3,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":18135729,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"AST02","rComments":"Very easy class if you have any prior knowledge of astronomy, I didn't even have to open the book assigned. All the math done is ridiculously simple if you've any prior teaching in math. Easy way to get a math or science GE out of the way, I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the subject of astronomy.

He answers questions thoroughly and was pretty well organized. The only reason you'd do horribly in the class is if you don't read or come to class. The material is straightforward. Good class, amazing subject.

He is a great professor, knows what he is talking about and his lectures are very easy to understand. The math part is the hard part, unless you are a math person. The tests are base from lecture and book, so read the book too. He is quite humorous, knows some magic tricks, and his lecture slides are great","rDate":"12/07/2010","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":3,"rOverallString":"3.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
