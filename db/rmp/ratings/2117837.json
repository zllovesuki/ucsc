Incredibly patient and kind. He really cares and you won't feel awkward about asking for help. Encourages questions. Gives you fair warning before calling on you. Great tests. Encourages mistakes as learning opportunities. Interested in building confidence and fluency more than perfect pronunciation/spelling.","rDate":"06/05/2016","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"N/A","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"Yes","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"A","teacherRatingTags":["Inspirational","Caring","ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
