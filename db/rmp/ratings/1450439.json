Barry is a great at what he does. The class could be incredibly dry, but Barry makes it more than bearable. He is funny and makes what could be a boring, intimidating, dry class, into a class worth taking.","rDate":"01/08/2014","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Low","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":22572342,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":2,"rClass":"ENVS115","rComments":"You rarely need to read the textbook, I wouldn't of bought it if I knew that in advance. He gives great study guides for the tests (easiest part of the course, with curve too). The lab section was difficult and extremely time consuming(but totally doable) but that's where you learn the most.
