You have to attend his lectures to get the most out of this class.  I've never learned this much from a Chem lab before.  He makes everything so understandable and he's fun to listen to during lecture.  I have to stress that completing the lab reports is so important for this class and it makes the final easy.","rDate":"12/16/2005","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":11136201,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"OCHEM108L","rComments":"i got an A- in his lab; very easy class. 70% is lab and 30% final ( u have to pass final). i wish i took ochem 108 over summer b/c he teaches it. even if it would be 10wk course for a 2 qtr subject, he is extremely clear, helpful, happy. he wont just give u the answer but makes you think about it. best teacher ever!!","rDate":"12/13/2005","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Mandatory","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":11046353,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"112L","rComments":"Nothing else to say... he is FABULOUS.
