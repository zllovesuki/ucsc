He webcasts his lectures, provides plenty of optional practice problems and posts detailed review material for exams. His exams are tough but attending his office hours, discussion section, and reading the book really helped. Michael is a great lecturer and is an approachable guy.

He didn't test on the main stuff, he tested on the minutiae. Stuff he would mention ONCE very briefly showed up ROUTINELY on exams, plus its never clear exactly what he's going to test on. He is perfectly happy with 70% averages on exams. Lectures confusingly organized. Studied my ass off, still no A.","rDate":"12/15/2015","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":3,"rOverallString":"3.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"B+","teacherRatingTags":["Tough Grader","Skip class?

Also, grading is a bit unreasonable. I got in the 85% range on every assignment, even though the averages should have merited a curve. Also did 2 extra credit assignments. Still got a B. Seems unfair to ask for students to do extra credit if you aren't going to give them any.","rDate":"06/18/2013","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":3.5,"rOverallString":"3.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":21763023,"notHelpCount":1,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":4,"rClass":"BIO100","rComments":"Great teacher, super clear and concise. Goes at a fast pace but once you get used it to it, the lectures are enjoyable. Tests are moderately hard, but if you study enough and maybe get a hold on a old exam, you'll do well.

He presented the material clearly and I learned a lot. The 1st midterm was a little hard but no surprises.
