Also check out her office hours, very easy to approach.","rDate":"06/16/2015","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"Yes","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":["Caring","Clear grading criteria"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"person"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":1,"id":24960874,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"PHYS6B","rComments":"She started off with an insanely long first midterm but eased off as the quarter went on.
