Although the book we read was dry, she was so helpful in understanding the text and taking a stance in papers.

The only con I would say is that her lectures were jumbled and unclear. However, she's very helpful during office hours and through email. Tests are easy, overall if you are planning on taking logic at UCSC, Kaija's the one the best one to choose.","rDate":"05/11/2009","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":3,"rOverallString":"3.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
