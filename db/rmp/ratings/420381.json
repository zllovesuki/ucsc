She is somewhat entertaining and very knowledgeable, and is receptive to students during lectures. She used to read just from notes but became much more dynamic. The TAs did most of the grading, but the assignments were interesting.

If you're interested in the subject, then you'll enjoy it. If not, then have fun trying to stay awake. A lot depends on the TA you have. My TA usually went on power trips based on her own opinions. Deanna, however, seemed nice and approachable...
