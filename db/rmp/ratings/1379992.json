His tests can be pretty difficult, but overall I think he's a really good teacher. He definitely knows his stuff, is super nice and very approachable. I went to his office hours a lot during the quarter, and he was always very helpful. Go to class, get a copy of the textbook (and actually read it)  and you'll do fine.","rDate":"12/20/2011","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":18148043,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":5,"rClass":"ECON100B","rComments":"Professor Gorry isn't as bad as some people are saying.  His class is dull/boring, but it is not hard by any means.  Just reading the chapter one, or doing his study guide guarantees a high grade.  He also curved our first exam so that a 35/100 was a C- for those who failed.

Lectures are pretty straightforward, however, he leaves it up to you to make it interesting for yourself. Otherwise, make sure you pay attention when he derives equations on the board. That is the key to this class. Go to MSI sections--absolutely incredibly helpful. You have to put in time to do well in this class.","rDate":"11/10/2010","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":3,"rOverallString":"3.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":16913683,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"poor","rClarity":3,"rClass":"ECON100B","rComments":"Don't even bother going to lecture, he basically reads off the power points.

Gorry spends the entire class rambling about a particular graph he found interesting. Then he spends about 5 minutes on the formulas that you actually need to know for the exams.
