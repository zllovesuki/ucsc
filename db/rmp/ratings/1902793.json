Maziar is engaging and makes syntax interesting for his students.

He's open-minded, too.","rDate":"01/23/2016","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":["Inspirational","Gives good feedback","Amazing lectures"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"person"},{"attendance":"Not Mandatory","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":1,"id":23528414,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"LING111","rComments":"Maziar was great.
