She always seemed nervous during her lectures, but she definitely knows her stuff and she goes out of her way to help students. At times, the lecture will tend to slump into &quot;this slide means.. and the next slide is...&quot; which can be horribly boring, but the TAs do a great job as well.","rDate":"11/23/2005","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":3475571,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":3,"rClass":"OCEA80B","rComments":"Horrible. Don't go to class if you don't feel like sleeping. Went to less than half the classes,a lot of the times left b/c so incredibly boring. All she does is pwrpnt, reading off it. Book isn't helpful either (TA told us not to read).  Just study the slides she posts.
