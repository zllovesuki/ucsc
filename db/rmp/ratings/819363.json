She did not create a syllabus for the class and so we would stray off on tangent topics for weeks, often for longer than was needed. I wouldn't have gotten through the course if not for the TA's.

She's not terrible, but avoid her if you can.","rDate":"03/11/2006","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":2.5,"rOverallString":"2.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
