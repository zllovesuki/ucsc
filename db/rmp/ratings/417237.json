The more I put efforts into the class, the worse I got. I hope he made his grading criteria clearer, so I could know where did I do wrong. Instead, he graded based on his mood. He said he compared my answer to others' answers in the class when I asked why. I mean, why don't you just follow certain standard and curve later?","rDate":"12/22/2014","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Meh","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":12037411,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"STEV","rComments":"oh whatever hes not that bad","rDate":"06/27/2006","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"poor","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"poor","helpCount":0,"id":2776636,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awful","rClarity":1,"rClass":"MERR80Y","rComments":"Quite possibly the worst class and professor i will ever have to suffer through.
