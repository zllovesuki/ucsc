In a way, she's a bit of a pushover because she lets students get away with a lot of things, but her TA lays down a hard law for her. For sure take this class if you like Psych.","rDate":"01/03/2016","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"B+","teacherRatingTags":["Inspirational","Participation matters","Caring"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
