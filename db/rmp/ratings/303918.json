If you know what you are doing and pay attention then you'll do fine. If you slack off and don't do any work then your grade will reflect. DO NOT PUT THE LABS OFF UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE YOU WILL REGRET IT. Also work with a partner. It is much easier.","rDate":"12/02/2011","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":19072875,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":4,"rClass":"CMPS5J","rComments":"charlie knows whats up","rDate":"10/14/2011","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":3.5,"rOverallString":"3.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":18962442,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"CS5J","rComments":"Charlie is extremely helpful, especially if you go to his office hours.
