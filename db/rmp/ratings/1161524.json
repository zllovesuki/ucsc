He copies from the book and rewrites it on the board, literally. Attendance is mandatory, which makes the class feel pointless, as you could just read the book.  He is fair with HW, quizzes, & tests. I had him for summer session, his teaching may be different in regular quarter.","rDate":"09/30/2008","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Low","rOverall":3,"rOverallString":"3.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
