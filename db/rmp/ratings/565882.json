If you did the readings theres no point in going to class because he's  going to say exactly what you read( which makes you not want to read!!!!) I had a hard time not dying of boredom in this class.

If you don't know basic lighting already, don't take this, he operates as if somethings were self explanatory that are not.  Interesting and educational though.","rDate":"11/14/2005","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":2,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":1.5,"rOverallString":"1.5","rStatus":3,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"person","usefulGrouping":"person"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":3321164,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"THEA19","rComments":"Knows the material and makes it interesting and fun.
