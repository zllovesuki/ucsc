The main point is that instead of imparting knowledge of physics to non-science majors, he overburdens and in the end wastes everyones (read, mine) time. He loses homework assignments and it is impossible to get credit or have him take credit for his errors. He is disorganized.","rDate":"03/13/2008","rEasy":5,"rEasyString":"5.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":1,"rOverallString":"1.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"poor","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":3922474,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"poor","rClarity":1,"rClass":"CONCEPTUALPHYS","rComments":"sure he's a nice guy, but i don't think i'm alone by saying that he makes no sense. his tests are killer (don't let &quot;openbook/opennote&quot; fool you), and his demonstrations are entertaining but very confusing.","rDate":"05/25/2005","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"poor","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"poor","helpCount":0,"id":3887443,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awful","rClarity":1,"rClass":"PHYSICS1","rComments":"Terry had really interesting demonstrations but I had no idea what they were supposed to be illustrating.
