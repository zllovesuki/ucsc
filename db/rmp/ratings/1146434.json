He definitely shows enthusiasm for the subject, too. I think he's learning to be a better teacher and in a couple quarters, he'll have improved greatly. For now though, he puts thorough notes online to supplement his lectures.","rDate":"06/25/2008","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":3.5,"rOverallString":"3.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":14581077,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":3,"rClass":"MATH21","rComments":"His teaching style got better through the quarter, or I understood more as the quarter went along. The class is good if you a Math major, but difficult if you've not used to math.
