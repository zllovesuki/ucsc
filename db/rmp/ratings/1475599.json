She makes the midterm very difficult on purpose so don't freak out if you bomb it.  Do your homework and the final is much more manageable than the MT.  I definitely recommend her.  Tod Lowe's class easier, but still highly recommend taking Dietlind if you can.","rDate":"09/09/2010","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
