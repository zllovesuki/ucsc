Although the films we saw were kind of weird or violent, they were all interesting in some way by providing a newfound awareness of other countries and their cinema. She is an approachable, nice and cool person too.","rDate":"04/21/2006","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":11598608,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":2,"rClass":"FILM132B","rComments":"I have a problem with this woman. She failed to warn for sexual violence in the films she showed, which were nearly all full of misogynist sentiments that she almost always failed to acknowledge in lecture. Her teaching style is mediocre. But I rather liked that there was a film in every lecture. And my TA, Matt, was all kinds of fabulous.","rDate":"03/22/2006","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":2.5,"rOverallString":"2.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":11591795,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":3,"rClass":"FILM132B","rComments":"Easy, not too many assignments, lectures short but very broad. Tests are very detailed yet she does not tell you what to study for at all. Great TAs, Matt was good, but to mention he is great eye candy. She is knowledgable obviously, but she does not radiate it in lecture. Needs a lot of improvement, it's not too late because she is a new prof.","rDate":"03/20/2006","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":3,"rOverallString":"3.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
