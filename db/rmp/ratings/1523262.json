She is a great teacher if you are willing to put forth effort in yourself and your work. :)","rDate":"08/07/2011","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"poor","helpCount":0,"id":18085046,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"poor","rClarity":2,"rClass":"KRSGWRT1","rComments":"She's a great, energectic teacher and she's very helpful.
