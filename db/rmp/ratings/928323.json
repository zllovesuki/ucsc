He's condescending, sarcastic and doesn't care about students' needs. I dreaded going to this class and am so happy it's over. The curve was really low so it's not hard to get a good grade, but it's the teacher that makes the class a drag.","rDate":"07/14/2009","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":15944796,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":4,"rClass":"ECON135","rComments":"Probably one of the best teachers at UCSC, one of the HARDEST classes I have ever taken but it was worth it, he is loud and in your face and it is hilarious, he learns everyone's name and cold calls a lot. If you slack off he will make fun of you in front of the entire class, class was never boring. If you can handle hard work take this class.","rDate":"06/09/2009","rEasy":5,"rEasyString":"5.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":12758227,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"ECON135","rComments":"His class is no joke, but he was probably the best professor I had at SC.  Take this class, even if u get a C, I think it's worth it.  And yeah, this dude is laughs.
