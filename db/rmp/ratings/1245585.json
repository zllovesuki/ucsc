Professor Sadjadpour is so bad. He is not an engineer, he is a mathematician. To whoever, think's he is the best professor at UCSC, wait until you take a Petersen class. His exams are the same as the year before. He needs to change them so that \"lucky\" students won't Ace his exam.","rDate":"08/05/2015","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":1,"rOverallString":"1.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"C","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":23554023,"notHelpCount":4,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"EE103","rComments":"He is the litmus test for electrical/computer engineering majors who think they are good at mathematics.

Super clear and funny. Ask questions! He will happily answer them (even though he might make some fun of you on the way-but joke back with him and you'll be on his good side). Write down all of the \"Golden Rules\". Exam problems are straight from HW (mostly).
