I went into the class not interested in the topic and left the class extremely interested. If you don't like the class you should get to know her better. One of the most helpful teachers at UCSC, more than understanding of any problems personal/professional that the student may have.

If you see her during Office Hours and talk, she will like you and give you a better grade if she knows your name. Class size is small too so she notices if your absent.
