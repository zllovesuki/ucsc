The lectures are always fun to go to and are very interesting.

She has blank pdf of each chapter that you can print out and write all over, which makes class so much easier. She posts plenty of practice midterms and even offers a review session before each midterm and final. As long as you study the lecture notes the class isn't too bad. hw mandatory!","rDate":"05/20/2015","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"person","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
