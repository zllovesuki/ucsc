First, you kill about 100 trees in that class w all the crap you have to print/not ever use. She grades really harshly then gives terrible, irrelevant, and useless feedback.

She is very helpful when you attend her office hours as she provides insight and advice towards your essay. The reading is a lot when you have other courses to take, but if you really want to improve your writing then you have to take the time to do the assignments.","rDate":"03/18/2015","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":["Caring","Gives good feedback","Get ready to read"],"unUsefulGrouping":"person","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":24228110,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":2,"rClass":"WRITING80A","rComments":"Attending her class is really boring. Has a lot of peer editing. Her \"quizzes\" are really tests, super long and tedious. Don't print out the handouts, it's a waste of paper and money. Would call on the same people in class. Make sure to edit your essays after every peer editing. Won't recommend taking this teacher's writing class.","rDate":"01/05/2015","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Meh","rOverall":2.5,"rOverallString":"2.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
