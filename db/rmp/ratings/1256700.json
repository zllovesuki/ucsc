She is a very enthusiastic teacher and open. However, it is very apparent that she lacks experience--often making mistakes in the lectures. She could improve alot on providing students with more adept practice exams and homeworks. Besides her flaws from inexperience, she makes the class somewhat interesting..","rDate":"03/21/2009","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":2,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":15500594,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"PHYS6A","rComments":"For being a graduate student, Deva has far surpassed several of the ACTUAL professors that I have had.
