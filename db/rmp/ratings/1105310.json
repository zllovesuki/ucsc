Nick was a good teacher and lecturer, but for being an art history class, we barely looked at actual slides. He taught as if he were teaching a philosophy course and I didn't learn much, if anything at all. The prompts he gave for the papers were always vague, and I never knew where to take them.","rDate":"04/16/2008","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":2,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":14250055,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"HAVC106A","rComments":"People complained about the difficulty in this class, but Morrissey's expectations are realistic considering the depth with which he lectures.

His tests are ridiculously hard, as if he expects each person in the class to completely understand the 150 pages of reading the test is on.
