She asked open ended questions looking for specific answers and if we needed time to think she accused us all of not doing the readings. She did not accept a drs note when I came down with the flu during midterms. Commenting in class was 10% of the grade but she only called on students that were going with her program.","rDate":"12/07/2013","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":1.5,"rOverallString":"1.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":21375625,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":3,"rClass":"ANTH102A","rComments":"I learned more with the tutor than in lecture/lab. Was struggling and went to her office hours and she was absolutely no help. The class size dwindled in part to the difficulty of the course but also due to her lackings as an instructor.

She really knows her Anthropology and is always willing to help students in need. The quizzes are really easy to get A's on as long as you make flashcards. The exams were pretty tough, but they were curved. Overall a pretty effective teacher and not too bad on the eyes either. ;)","rDate":"01/08/2013","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":21139889,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":3,"rClass":"ANTHR101","rComments":"Quizzes/labs/assignments were 55% of our total grade.
