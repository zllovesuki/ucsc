She is a very happy person and it rubs off. The class is hard unless you really know your music. Sections are hard too and the TA I had wasn't too helpful.

She's humorous, encourages participation, her english and accent is fine, although it may be hard to understand her explanations once in a while.  Always encourages students to go to her office hours or the TA's office hours if they need help.","rDate":"04/01/2008","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":3.5,"rOverallString":"3.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"poor","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"poor","helpCount":0,"id":12798720,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awful","rClarity":1,"rClass":"MUS100A","rComments":"HORRIBLE teacher. Don't take her. Her accent is so thick much will be unintelligible. She doesn't speak English well enough to answer questions accurately, she often gets the question completely wrong. She is rude to students.
