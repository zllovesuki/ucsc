He is much better one-on-one: talk to him at office hours.","rDate":"05/06/2013","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":19790719,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"poor","rClarity":2,"rClass":"ECON101","rComments":"i fall asleep every class...","rDate":"02/01/2012","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":2,"rInterest":"Low","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":11986252,"notHelpCount":1,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"ECON106","rComments":"easy going professor. dry lecture, encourages discussion. not that writing intensive though, which was appreciated(even for a W class). i'd take another class from him if it wasn't early in the morning.","rDate":"06/08/2006","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"person","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":11982106,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"ECON165","rComments":"Dan is the Man!!
