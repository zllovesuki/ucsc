He's a god guy and helps you out as much as he can. Go to MSI! or read the book.  I went to all the MSI sections and found it to be more helpful than class. His tests are pretty funny too talking about superheroes and Disney characters.  I've seen worse teachers than him.","rDate":"12/01/2011","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":3.5,"rOverallString":"3.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"poor","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":19154855,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":1,"rClass":"AMS7","rComments":"Yuefeng is genuinely a nice guy. I asked him to move the midterm back a day because it was the day after Halloween, and he did, no problem, saying &quot;I hope you have time to plan a party!&quot; (completely serious). Unfortunately his english isn't great and he speaks softly, so he's hard to understand. Lecture is completely pointless in my opinion.
