The class seemed to be generously graded, but the final grade was much lower than expected. The written homeworks were alright, and the last programming homework was difficult. Final exam was much harder than the midterm.","rDate":"03/21/2016","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"B","teacherRatingTags":["Tough Grader","Respected","GROUP PROJECTS"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Not Mandatory","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":26152968,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"CMPS101","rComments":"Great class! Professor Vishwanathan (vishy) was very clear and explained the subject as many times as necessary so everybody could understand and be on the same page.
