This is extremely valuable in a teacher teaching over an extremely interesting class (at least he made it interesting). He could have better time management with the material he wants the class to learn, but other than that, you will learn a lot, and the resources he offers will keep you in line.","rDate":"06/02/2016","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"N/A","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"Yes","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":["Amazing lectures","ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","Caring"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Mandatory","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":26684736,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"CMPS128","rComments":"Really passionate, interesting, engaging lectures.
