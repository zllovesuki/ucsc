He gives random pop quizzes. They are open note quizzes but even though you take notes, you will barely get any right. He makes us sign in in his lectures and deducts points if you miss a class or if you are late. I would never take this class again.","rDate":"03/09/2016","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":["BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES","LECTURE HEAVY","Skip class?

Be prepared to spend several hours daily in the print studio or at home working on projects. Enrique can be disorganized and unclear with project guidelines, make sure to ask for clarification. Also, go to office hours because he has a lot of printmaking knowledge. Plus, he's nicer outside of class time.","rDate":"12/20/2014","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":3,"rOverallString":"3.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"person"}]
