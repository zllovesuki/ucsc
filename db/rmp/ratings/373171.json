It really helps to record lectures, because Maggie talks fast with a lot of detail.  She knows EVERYTHING about vertebrates, so you learn a lot!  She's also nice and fairly humorous. The lab is also super hard but interesting! You learn fish, amphibs, reptiles, birds, and mammals.","rDate":"04/19/2007","rEasy":5,"rEasyString":"5.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":12937056,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":4,"rClass":"BIOL138","rComments":"Ugh, I hated this class.

Lectures revolve around the labs.  Two major papers and a final project.  Learn everything from how to make fiels maps to setting up field studys.
