Josh is still (I'm a third-year now) the most engaging, passionate, and down-to-earth professor I've ever had. His lectures are fleshed-out with powerpoints/visuals and interesting readings (sometimes a lot) to back them up. If you can take a class from him, DO IT, he'll make you think.","rDate":"08/07/2012","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":20522625,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"HAVC80K","rComments":"Great lecturer!
