I rarely feel like I'm in a university class. There's a tremendous amount of busywork and pointless groupwork. As far as Education teachers go, she's totally one of the worst. Only good thing is that she's very nice and she means well.","rDate":"03/16/2006","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":3,"rOverallString":"3.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":11479318,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":2,"rClass":"EDUC125","rComments":"This class is very relevant to those who want to go into elementary teaching, if you are not interested in this, I would not recommend the class.  Judy is very unclear, repetative, and sometimes quite boring.  However, she means very well and will do almost anything to accomodate your needs.  Plan on frequent trips to the library if you take this.","rDate":"02/13/2006","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":3,"rOverallString":"3.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
