Jorge is hilarious, and it's cool because it's like you have to get to know him before you get his jokes. He really got me interested in everything from syntax and phonetics to Turkish and weird little languages. Don't take this class if you're not willing to work though.","rDate":"12/14/2004","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":2914320,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"poor","rClarity":2,"rClass":"LING20","rComments":"No Comments","rDate":"12/05/2004","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":2,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":2883616,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"LING20","rComments":"my first linguistics class, and i was in love. LOVE l-o-v-e and all the rest. it's true, jorge does not make concessions for students who are not intending to follow up on linguistics...then he doesn't make many for the actual major/minors either. but it's worth it, because he challenges students.","rDate":"12/02/2004","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":2729015,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"LING20","rComments":"He's a damn fine teacher, and one of the best assests to UCSC.
