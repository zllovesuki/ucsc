Psych 100 was very boring, but 119S is great and she gives very good articles. You can tell she's new at teaching and goes fast on slides, but is easy to communicate and relate to. Study guide is extremely helpful too. I had a bad TA for 100 though, if you don't agree with a grade go straight to her.","rDate":"05/09/2014","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"B+","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"person"},{"attendance":"Mandatory","clarityColor":"poor","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":22855471,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"poor","rClarity":1,"rClass":"PSYC100","rComments":"Easy class, but as a psychologist, Dr. Shapiro is strangely uneducated about the field of psychology. The class was oversimplified to the point that statistics became a data entry exercise with no effort to explain the meaning of the tests or results.  If you are serious about research, take this course with another instructor.","rDate":"02/20/2014","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Not Mandatory","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":22833238,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"PSYCH10","rComments":"I definitely enjoyed having her as a teacher. She does a pretty good job of lecturing and providing useful examples. She is very open to feedback from students and answers every question that a student asked her. Her SGs were pretty helpful and her tests are fair. It's one of those you get what you put in classes which was great for me.","rDate":"02/11/2014","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"Mandatory","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":22313463,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"PSYCH100","rComments":"Shapiro is a wonderful lecturer.

I believe this was her first quarter teaching and she turned research methods into such a clear and straightforward subject. I was really hesitant about taking this class since it was a 7 unit class but the way she progressed us through the research paper was flawless. I hope she teaches other courses soon.","rDate":"03/07/2013","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
