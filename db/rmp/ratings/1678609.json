Yes, he is very good looking and young as if he were a student himself. Everything is well organized in his class. You may be confused if you have never taken any Architecture class before. Ask the TA for help.

He looks kind of like Hayden Christensen. Definitely a plus when going to class. He was a good teacher; explained the concepts well and was clear, but he wasn't stellar. Sometimes he got snappy with students, but there was one really annoying kid in the class, so it was kind of understandable","rDate":"09/27/2012","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":2,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":3.5,"rOverallString":"3.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":20579897,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":4,"rClass":"HAVC43","rComments":"If you're interested in architecture and art history, if not you won't like it.

He's also really good looking, good motivation to attend class.","rDate":"08/16/2012","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":3.5,"rOverallString":"3.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":20269846,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"HAVC43","rComments":"The lectures are intertwined so that the course acts fantastically as a whole.  The course is best suited to an ambitious philosopher or one with an inclination towards theoretical and abstract thinking.  That said, the final is surprisingly easy, and consists of learning by rote.  The potential for profundity is there, however.","rDate":"05/13/2012","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":19917760,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":4,"rClass":"HAVC43","rComments":"This is one of my favorite classes I have taken, but that was probably because I love art history and architecture.
