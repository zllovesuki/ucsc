Lectures, assignments, and exams were very straightforward. No, there were no study guides, but all the info you needed to pass was in the lectures, and if you failed to notice that, then you were either absent a lot or not paying attention. He is enthusiastic about the subject and is very approachable.","rDate":"08/29/2010","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":17433841,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"SOCY105A","rComments":"I'm taking John's class over the summer, and I agree with a previous poster that he does not make study guides. It's hard to study this way, but everything on the test has been covered in his powerpoints. Put in the effort and you will get an A. Also he has a great personality; very nice, thoughtful and friendly.","rDate":"07/20/2010","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"poor","helpCount":0,"id":17411595,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"poor","rClarity":2,"rClass":"SOC105A","rComments":"Moss is probably the worst professor to take if you even have any interest in the class prior to instruction. His powerpoints are full of useless information that aren't on the tests, he doesn't give out study guides just tells you to study everything and is overall just a horrible lecturer.","rDate":"07/12/2010","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Low","rOverall":1.5,"rOverallString":"1.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":16912628,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"poor","rClarity":3,"rClass":"SOCY15","rComments":"I had him as a ta and he was not helpful at all","rDate":"03/25/2010","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Meh","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":16688343,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":4,"rClass":"SOC121","rComments":"John is a good professor.

Requires you to do work that he does not clearly state.  Then when you go and ask him for help, its not worth going in for help. He also isn't clear when he teaches or what he assigns.  I would not recommend taking a class with him. Some people seem to have a natural skill to teach, but he isn't one of them.","rDate":"04/28/2009","rEasy":5,"rEasyString":"5.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Meh","rOverall":1,"rOverallString":"1.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
