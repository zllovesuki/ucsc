He was in fact extremely helpful, I got a D- in my first paper, he helped me improve it and I manage to pass the class with a B but it was sweating bullets.  Other than that the films were awesome and the variety to die for. I recommend his class to any film student.","rDate":"08/02/2015","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"Yes","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"B","teacherRatingTags":["Tough Grader","Clear grading criteria","Caring"],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"poor","helpCount":0,"id":21462909,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"poor","rClarity":2,"rClass":"FILM80S","rComments":"Easily the worst professor I've ever had. He was a terrible lecturer who just droned on about the same concepts all quarter long without ever progressing his ideas. He showed more good films than bad ones, so thank God there was some relief to the agony that was his lectures. Still the class was amazingly easy if you're just looking for a grade.","rDate":"03/29/2013","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":1.5,"rOverallString":"1.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":21179550,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"FILM136","rComments":"I took film 136D with Professor Kahana, and I really enjoyed it. He was interesting and showed good films. He used power point when lecturing, but kept it to a minimum. He did not assign too much homework, 4 essays, 5 small quizzes (not hard), and a multiple choice final (The final was worded in a confusing way and was tough). Overall good class.","rDate":"12/28/2012","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":20398677,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":4,"rClass":"FILM80S","rComments":"Kahana's class is pretty easy. Just watch the films, do the readings (which aren't many) and write 4 essays, 3 that are only 700 words each. The only drawback is that Kahana's lectures are incredibly boring. I've fallen asleep in his class numerous times.

However, I wish Kahana would've let students ask questions and speak in class. Work load wasn't too bad. A couple of papers, short quizzes, and a final. Just read the book and you will do fine.","rDate":"06/09/2012","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":3.5,"rOverallString":"3.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
