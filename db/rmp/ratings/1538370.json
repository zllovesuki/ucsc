She is also very sweet. I didn't read the book much, but that probably would have made the class easier. There are quizzes every so often along with one midterm and one final. A lot of open discussion about the topics.","rDate":"12/09/2012","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":18286393,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"JAPN103","rComments":"Okamoto sensei is whip smart, so don't be deceived by her polite demeanor. She is a keen observer of sociolinguistics and while her classes aren't necessarily hard, one can deduce the ins and outs of tactical japanese speech. She has a dry humor that is subtle but cutting and she doesn't respect the nice but dumb types. Love her.","rDate":"03/18/2011","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
