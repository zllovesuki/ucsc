He did not know how to hold the class's attention and wouldn't do thorough example problems.  This made it really difficult for those of us not adept at physics.

He is great at helping students and he's approachable. He makes physics interesting (cool demos). Joe's intelligent and has a lot of potential for upcoming quarters.
