She was very confusing and a dry lecturer. Did not provide any powerpoint notes or summaries of what she lectured - it was all her talking in front of the class. The class moved very fast paced & she was very inconsiderate with the HUGE amount of work given and the LACK of resources.","rDate":"12/10/2013","rEasy":5,"rEasyString":"5.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":1,"rOverallString":"1.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":20286664,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"LTSP131B","rComments":"This was a very interesting class. Through the different texts one is able to see the various points of view of the Mexican Revolutionaries. Klahn is a very good professor in the sense that she explains herself and is always open to answer any doubts. She is also a very good listener.","rDate":"05/15/2012","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
