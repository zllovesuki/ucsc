The lectures are really interesting. Audrey is amazing how she listens to everyone and tries to answer and keep everything smooth. She asked us all to write on what could be better about the class. The tests are sort of hard tho, you have to know all the details. I'm still glad I took it with her tho.","rDate":"08/29/2007","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"poor","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"poor","helpCount":0,"id":12425312,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awful","rClarity":1,"rClass":"PSYCH170","rComments":"horrible horrible horrible horrible, shes really nice, but a bad teacher, she seems like she is so carefree and doesnt seem to care about you or anything else, i asked her for help and she said she couldnt, the tests are straightforward if youve done the reading, but dont rely on her for help. she answered every question in class with &quot;i dont know&quot;","rDate":"11/15/2006","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":1,"rOverallString":"1.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":12252894,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":3,"rClass":"PSYC170","rComments":"I took 'Abnormal Psych' as a lower division course. I thought an upper division version would be even more interesting, I was wrong. Audrey follows the text very closely, almost until the point where you don't need to go to lecture, except to see the guest lecturers. The quizes/exams are hard, a lot of info. Read the book and you'll do fine.","rDate":"09/27/2006","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
