While I think John Jordan seems like a nice man, his lectures are all the same, and are all equally tedious.  Perhaps the class is far too big, and I am far too critical.

Did a nice job of providing mostly useful and entertaining lectures. Reasonable academic workload paper-wise, but reading-wise... TOO MANY BOOKS ASSIGNED!

The lectures are always interesting, John is extremely animated and enthusiastic, and the books are fantastic.  The reading load is admittedly kind of heavy, but when you're reading Sherlock Holmes it doesn't seem like a chore.

He reminds me of Mr. Rogers. Keep in mind that this class was a little unusual, as it was a weeklong program over the summer. Still, you get five credits and anybody can do it.
