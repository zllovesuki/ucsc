Her class is informative, organized and fun. She follows syllabus and is very clear about what she expects. Attendance is mandatory so GO TO CLASS! If you show up, do readings (which aren't a lot) and participate you will get a good grade. She is nice, helpful and engages you in her lectures.

I LOVE THIS CLASS. I used to hate any sort of history, but she always engages the class and makes it very enjoyable. I highly recommend this class. She makes all the requirements crystal clear.

You have a lot of reading, but you get into groups and go over the reading, then go over it as a whole class. By the time you get to the midterm and final, you know everything and don't even have to put more than an hours worth of studying. She will go out of her way to help you with anything class related.
