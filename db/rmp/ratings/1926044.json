One of the best economic teachers Ive ever had at ucsc. WHY DIDNT I TAKE HIM SOONER is what I said to myself the whole time in class. Lots of writing involved, but it's fairly easy. Take 197 over 104, I took both. 104 has PROGRAMMING and intense papers and lots of 113 material. 197 is writing and talking about econ issues.

He makes you think and he teaches you how to write without the pain of doing it. He is a \"no b.s.\" person and definitely loves his students. I wish he taught more classes because I would take all of them.
