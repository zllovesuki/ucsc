He cares so much about his subject matter and his students, and it shows. He was choked up on the last day of class because he was going to miss us all. Really learned a lot, and loved the class. He invited me to take a grad seminar with him the next year.","rDate":"05/03/2010","rEasy":5,"rEasyString":"5.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"person","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":16970279,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"ENVS122","rComments":"Like Greg said in the beginning of the quarter, &quot;this class isn't about pictures of furry animals&quot; (though there were some pretty cool pictures!).
