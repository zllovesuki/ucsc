Please do not take this class. The quizzes and essay are fairly easy, but like I said the final could drop your grade right off the bat. This professor says she does not trick people, but she does.

It is easy, low-maintenance and attendance is not required to receive a good grade. Do your work and study for exams and you will do just fine. As an instructor, she is competent and likable, though she obviously finds some of the material as monotonous as we do.","rDate":"11/23/2011","rEasy":1,"rEasyString":"1.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"poor","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":19249467,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":4,"rClass":"EART901","rComments":"Very easy class as long as you do the assignments, which are easy..

Very helpful and a great TA as well. Sends all the slides to you via email. No section, very little homework and it is very easy.

The slides were a little hard to keep up with, but she was willing to slow things down according to student needs. Better to keep up with the textbook reading.
