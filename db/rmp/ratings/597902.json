Overall, she means really well and will do her absolute best to help you succeed and learn the material.  Decision Making and Problem Solving was one of the most interesting classes I have taken at UCSC.  I admit the weekly quizzes were horrible though.  I would still recommend the class.","rDate":"02/13/2006","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":4000464,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"average","rClarity":2,"rClass":"PSYC139","rComments":"She gave quizzes every week that the majority of the class failed every week. For the midterm instead of giving a study guide, she gave a what NOT to study guide. Everyone did so poorly she was forced to bump everyones grade up bringing the average to a C. Everyweek we had tedious &quot;group&quot;homework. I hated this class and I hated her.","rDate":"06/15/2005","rEasy":5,"rEasyString":"5.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":2.5,"rOverallString":"2.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
