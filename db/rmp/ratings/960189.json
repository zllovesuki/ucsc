But Jennie accounted for the fact that I tried hard anyway and sought her help when I thought I needed it. I came to class regularly, did all the assignments and did at least two of them pretty well, and she gave me a fair grade. After taking painting with Tim Craighead, I was relieved to take her class.","rDate":"03/20/2008","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":13781890,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":4,"rClass":"ART24","rComments":"She walks around the room during class, so you  have a lot of one-on-one conversations.  In her intro course, the assignments were very structured and we were only allowed to use oil paints, but i know that her advanced classes use at least acrylics too.  I think the assignments could have been better, but I did like the map assignment.","rDate":"12/09/2007","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":13333873,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"good","rClarity":3,"rClass":"ART103","rComments":"Best painting teacher I've ever had!!! She gives the most amazing feedback and critiques. However if you don't approach her, she'll just leave you be, you have to initiate communication. she treats students as artists. if you get a bad grade, it's because you didn't approach her and/or you didn't come to class on a regular basis.  Awesome teacher.","rDate":"07/16/2007","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":12931048,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"ART104","rComments":"Jennie was very helpful and friendly.
