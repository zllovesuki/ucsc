She even managed to get Elliot Aaronson as a guest speaker. Very helpful. Knows her stuff and knows how to teach. Everything is straightforward and organized. At first I thought the tests were too easy. In retrospect, it was because she taught so well. They were still ez though, no gimmicks or tricks. 1 APA paper @ end.","rDate":"02/22/2006","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":5,"rOverallString":"5.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":11394574,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"PSYCH140","rComments":"Dr. Siegel is a great instuctor!

She captures your attention very well.  The guest lecturers she chooses are awesome.  However, you do have to do all of the reading, and its not just a tiny bit either. I would say its worth it because you learn so much in the course.  Must attend all lectures and complete all readings + research paper.","rDate":"10/30/2005","rEasy":4,"rEasyString":"4.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":5,"rInterest":"It's my life","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
