He had a great sense of humor and his accent made lecture more interesting. His midterms were straightforward and had step-by-step explanations on how to do the harder problems. My only complaint is that the final was too difficult. He's much easier than Bauerle and Mitchell, my other two calc instructors.","rDate":"04/28/2009","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":4,"rOverallString":"4.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"poor","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"poor","helpCount":0,"id":15608055,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awful","rClarity":1,"rClass":"MATH19B","rComments":"Probably scary smart but [it doesn't show. Can't solve his own problems, terrible drawings and handwritings. Incoherent speech. Useless lectures. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Go to all discussions and expect his finals to be impossible anyway. His only redeeming quality is when he runs out of chalkboard and writes on the wall. Also his laugh is very funny.","rDate":"04/05/2009","rEasy":5,"rEasyString":"5.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Low","rOverall":1,"rOverallString":"1.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"poor","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"poor","helpCount":0,"id":15580569,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awful","rClarity":1,"rClass":"MATH23B","rComments":"Worst math class ever! Heavy accent but once you get used to it you still can't understand what he's talking about. There have even been a couple of times when he came to class unprepared and couldn't answer his own example problems. His examples didn't reflecte his random tests. If you have to take a class wait a quarter so you don't have Michail.","rDate":"03/29/2009","rEasy":5,"rEasyString":"5.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":1,"rOverallString":"1.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"poor","easyColor":"good","helpColor":"poor","helpCount":0,"id":15549537,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awful","rClarity":1,"rClass":"MATH23B","rComments":"I had a horrible time in this class, half the time I had no idea what he was saying. Most the material I taught myself. His tests are very tricky. There's just no way study for them because 90% of the time there is no hw problem or example in the book that compares to the tests. So do yourself a favor and don't take his class.","rDate":"03/20/2009","rEasy":5,"rEasyString":"5.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":1,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":1,"rOverallString":"1.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"average","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"average","helpCount":0,"id":15499623,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"poor","rClarity":2,"rClass":"MATH23","rComments":"I rarely attending class and learned everything from my section leader.","rDate":"03/02/2009","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":2,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"poor","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"poor","helpCount":0,"id":15323246,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"poor","rClarity":1,"rClass":"MATH19B","rComments":"Although Michail is nice guy that cares about his students, he was hard to understand 99% of the time and had terribly small hand writing.
