I took his class due to all the high reviews but he seemed a little on the flat, boring side. Maybe it was just the material (which seriously felt like a history class, not a film class). He was nice enough to talk to outside of class and his tests were ok. 2 scantron tests and one research paper made up the grade.","rDate":"06/10/2013","rEasy":3,"rEasyString":"3.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":3,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":3.5,"rOverallString":"3.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"Yes","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":20575698,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":4,"rClass":"FILM175","rComments":"Jesse is an excellent instructor.

Super clear, down-to-earth, friendly, approachable, funny, and a fantastic speaker. Knew his topics inside and out. There's not much more you can ask for in an instructor!

He's really friendly and fun, but not in an &quot;oh-look-how-cool-and-fun-I-am&quot; way. He's just a chill, enthusiastic, slightly awkward guy. Tons of fun to hear lecture. The class was a lot of work, but the work was like, taking pictures & writing & stuff. More fun than work, if you ask me. HOWEVER, he takes roll. :/","rDate":"12/11/2010","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":4,"rInterest":"Sorta interested","rOverall":4.5,"rOverallString":"4.5","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"No","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"},{"attendance":"N/A","clarityColor":"good","easyColor":"average","helpColor":"good","helpCount":0,"id":16925638,"notHelpCount":0,"onlineClass":"","quality":"awesome","rClarity":5,"rClass":"FILM20P","rComments":"Jesse is incredibly charismatic as a speaker.
