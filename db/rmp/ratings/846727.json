Besides not enjoying the technique that Nina was teaching, I thoroughly disliked her teaching style.  She contradicted herself a lot, was conceited, made us read her book and gave us no other views on the art form, and did not make me feel comfortable in the class.  Her style &character clashed with me.","rDate":"05/11/2006","rEasy":2,"rEasyString":"2.0","rErrorMsg":null,"rHelpful":2,"rInterest":"Really into it","rOverall":2,"rOverallString":"2.0","rStatus":1,"rTextBookUse":"N/A","rWouldTakeAgain":"N/A","sId":1078,"takenForCredit":"N/A","teacher":null,"teacherGrade":"N/A","teacherRatingTags":[],"unUsefulGrouping":"people","usefulGrouping":"people"}]
