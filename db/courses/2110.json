Course explores a variety of historically situated Latin American thinkers who investigate ethnic identity, gender, and socio-political inequality and liberation, and historical memory, and who have also made important contributions to mainstream analytical and continental philosophy.","re":null,"com":["42760","42761"],"sec":[{"num":"42762","sec":"01A","loct":[{"t":{"day":["Monday"],"time":{"start":"11:00","end":"12:10"}},"loc":"Crown Clrm 208"}],"ins":"Ortiz-Bautista,L.M.","cap":"30"},{"num":"42763","sec":"01B","loct":[{"t":{"day":["Wednesday"],"time":{"start":"12:30","end":"13:40"}},"loc":"Crown Clrm 208"}],"ins":"Ortiz-Bautista,L.M.","cap":"30"}]},"42768":{"ty":"Lecture","cr":"5","ge":["ER","E"],"desc":"Considers the historical, current, and future directions of Chicano/a literary culture within the context of the long-standing exchanges of culture and politics across the U.S.-Mexican border and the challenges of globalization.
