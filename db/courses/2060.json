For three decades, the old regime has been both breaking down and transforming itself while a new system is still under construction, with open-ended possibilities for the future. This course will disentangle continuity and change, reviewing broad trends in contemporary Mexican politics against the backdrop of long-term historical, social and economic change since the 1910–1917 revolution. The course defines \"political change\" in the broadest sense, looking at how power is both wielded from above and created from below.  The first half of the course explores how the Mexican political system works, both at national and local levels. The second half of the course concentrates on the rise of diverse grassroots movements, environmental challenges, and the politics of immigration and NAFTA. Discussion of US-Mexican relationships will go beyond analysis of relations between the governments to assess efforts to build coalitions among civil society groups in both countries.
